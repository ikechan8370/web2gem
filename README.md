## Overview

`web2gem` lets OpenAI-compatible and Google Gemini-compatible clients use Gemini Web through a familiar HTTP API. This branch adds a persistent account pool: import your own Gemini Web accounts once, and the service stores their operational state in D1, selects an available account for each request, and tracks failures, cooldowns, and refresh results.

A typical setup is:

1. Deploy the Worker or Docker service.
2. Configure D1 and one `ADMIN_KEY`.
3. Open `/admin` and import one or more Gemini accounts.
4. Optionally configure `API_KEYS` for client access.
5. Point your OpenAI-compatible or Gemini-compatible client at the deployed URL.

The main compatibility targets are:

## Core Features

| Feature                      | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Persistent account pool      | Store multiple Gemini Web accounts and their operational state in D1 instead of placing one account cookie directly in the runtime environment.  |
| Built-in admin console       | Import, inspect, filter, enable, disable, refresh, check, edit, and delete accounts from `/admin`.                                                 |
| Automatic account failover   | Try distinct eligible accounts up to `GEMINI_ACCOUNT_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default `10`), naturally capped by the eligible pool. |
| Account health tracking      | Record availability, cooldowns, failure reasons, refresh state, and request outcomes without exposing stored session credentials.                |
| Tool calling                 | Converts tool definitions into prompt instructions and parses DSML/XML-style tool-call output back into compatible API responses.                |
| Structured output            | Validates and canonicalizes final JSON for non-streaming structured responses; streaming structured output is rejected by default.               |
| Large context handling       | Large prompt context can be uploaded as Gemini text attachments through the account selected from the pool instead of remaining entirely inline. |
| Image generation             | Supports explicit OpenAI `image_generation` metadata for non-streaming Chat/Responses requests, plus `/v1/images/generations` and `/v1/images/edits`, using the selected account. |
| Image input handling         | Resolves user-provided inline/base64 images through the selected Gemini account. The Worker does not fetch remote image or file URLs.             |
| Generic file attachments     | Request-local `input_file` and inline non-image data can use Gemini Web upload references with arbitrary filenames and MIME types; persistent `/v1/files` storage is not implemented. |
| Worker and Docker deployment | Run on Cloudflare Workers with a native D1 binding or use Docker with the Cloudflare D1 HTTP binding.                                              |
| Upstream socket transport    | Workers prefer `cloudflare:sockets` when available; Docker uses standard `fetch`.                                                                 |
| Fail-closed operation        | Missing storage, unavailable accounts, invalid configuration, and admin failures return sanitized errors instead of falling back to embedded credentials. |

## Before You Start

For the full account-backed feature set, you need:

- one or more Gemini Web accounts that you are authorized to use;
- a Cloudflare D1 database;
- one strong `ADMIN_KEY` for the account console;
- for Docker, a Cloudflare account ID, D1 database ID, and API token;
- optionally, one or more `API_KEYS` if the public endpoint will be shared.

Short text-only requests can use Gemini Web anonymously without `GEMINI_DB`. Requests use anonymous upstream first when they have no file references or image operation, the rendered prompt is at most `CURRENT_INPUT_FILE_MIN_BYTES` (95,000 UTF-8 bytes by default), and the model is not a Pro model. Pro, long-context, attachment, image-generation, and image-edit requests require `GEMINI_DB` and a usable account. Gemini Web is an upstream web protocol and may change without notice; this project is best suited to personal, research, and internal use.

## API Surface

### Health

```sh
curl https://your-web2gem.example/
```

Returns service status, version, and the model IDs currently exposed by the adapter.

### OpenAI Chat Completions

```sh
curl https://your-web2gem.example/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gemini-3.5-flash",
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Write a concise project summary." }
    ]
  }'
```

Set `"stream": true` to receive Server-Sent Events.

For image generation, send explicit OpenAI image-generation metadata with a non-streaming request. The Worker routes requests with either `tool_choice: { "type": "image_generation" }` or a `tools[]` entry `{ "type": "image_generation" }` through a pass-through image path. This mode uses only user-authored prompt text plus user-provided inline/existing image inputs, rejects attachments-only prompts, and returns upstream text/images as data-image or URL markdown in Chat Completions. Remote image/file URLs are not fetched. A configured D1-backed Gemini account pool is required for image generation, image editing, and image byte fetching.

```sh
curl https://your-web2gem.example/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gemini-3.5-flash",
    "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Generate a small blue app icon." }],
    "tool_choice": { "type": "image_generation" }
  }'
```

### OpenAI Responses

```sh
curl https://your-web2gem.example/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gemini-3.5-flash",
    "input": "Explain what this worker does in one paragraph."
  }'
```

Responses image generation uses the same explicit metadata and returns `image_generation_call` output items with base64 `result` values when image bytes are available; URL-only image metadata is passed through as markdown output text. Streaming image generation is not supported.

### OpenAI Images API

`POST /v1/images/generations` and `POST /v1/images/edits` are supported as non-streaming image-generation routes. They do not require `tools` or `tool_choice`, but they still require the configured Gemini account pool.

```sh
curl https://your-web2gem.example/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gemini-3.5-flash",
    "prompt": "Generate a small blue app icon.",
    "response_format": "b64_json"
  }'
```

Image edits require `prompt` plus at least one local image input. JSON and multipart edit inputs can use `image`, `images`, `image_url`, or `input_image` with inline base64/data URL image bytes. Remote `http://` / `https://` image URLs are rejected and are not fetched by the Worker. Image endpoints support only `n: 1`, default `response_format` to `b64_json`, also accept `response_format: "url"` for provider URLs, and reject `stream: true`.

### Google Gemini API

```sh
curl https://your-web2gem.example/v1beta/models/gemini-3.5-flash:generateContent \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "contents": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "parts": [{ "text": "Return a short deployment checklist." }]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

For streaming, call `:streamGenerateContent` on the same model path.

## Models

`web2gem` exposes three public model families. Each family has a standard name
and an `-extended` name; extended names enable Gemini's extended-thinking flag.

| Model ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `gemini-3.1-pro` | Pro family through an authenticated account route. |
| `gemini-3.1-pro-extended` | Pro family with extended thinking. |
| `gemini-3.5-flash` | Default fast model; eligible text requests try anonymous Gemini first. |
| `gemini-3.5-flash-extended` | The same Flash route with extended thinking. |
| `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` | Flash Lite family through an authenticated account route. |
| `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-extended` | Flash Lite family with extended thinking. |

`GET /v1/models` and `GET /v1beta/models` build one ordered catalog from the
anonymous Flash baseline plus account discovery. A valid unknown provider model
ID is temporarily exposed as `<id>` and, when that alias does not collide with
another exact ID, `<id>-extended`; IDs that collide with the six known public
names are not projected. Dynamic IDs can be requested through the account that
discovered them. If no live catalog is usable, the last complete persisted
discovery snapshot is used. Without D1, both APIs still list the two Flash
names. Basic, Plus, Advanced, provider IDs, capacity fields, and model numbers
are internal routing data and are not public tier names.

Legacy aliases and `@think=N` are not supported. Custom model configuration is
also intentionally unsupported; only discovered upstream IDs can extend the
catalog.

## Quick Start

Anonymous-eligible text generation works without `GEMINI_DB`. Configure `GEMINI_DB`, import at least one account, and set `ADMIN_KEY` when you need Pro models, long context, attachments, image generation/editing, or account fallback. `API_KEYS` is optional but recommended for any shared endpoint.

### Option 1: Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

> Which method should I choose?
>
> - Want to try it quickly: use the **Deploy Button**.
> - Want automatic updates: use the **recommended method** below.

#### Quickest: Deploy Button (first deployment only)

Click the button below and follow the Cloudflare setup page:

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/Guardinary/web2gem/tree/gemini-account-pool)

During setup:

- Set `ADMIN_KEY` to protect the admin page.
- Set `API_KEYS` if clients should provide an API key; otherwise leave it empty.
- After deployment, open `/admin` and import your Gemini accounts.

The Deploy Button is for the first deployment only and does not provide automatic updates. Clicking it again creates another project instead of upgrading the existing Worker.

#### Recommended: automatic updates

Fork this repository first, then import the Fork into Cloudflare:

1. Open the [GitHub Fork page](https://github.com/Guardinary/web2gem/fork), clear **Copy the main branch only**, and create the Fork.
2. In the Fork, go to **Settings → Branches** and set `gemini-account-pool` as the default branch.
3. Go to **Actions**, enable **Upstream Sync**, and run it once. If it cannot push, set **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions** to **Read and write permissions**.
4. In Cloudflare Workers, import the Fork and deploy its default branch. Set `ADMIN_KEY`; `API_KEYS` is optional.

After setup, the Fork checks for updates every week. You can also run **Upstream Sync** manually whenever you want the latest version.

Avoid editing files directly on the Fork's `gemini-account-pool` branch, or automatic synchronization may stop and require manual conflict resolution.

<details>
<summary>Updating an existing Deploy Button clone</summary>

If you already deployed with the button, clone the generated repository and run:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Guardinary/web2gem.git
git fetch upstream gemini-account-pool
git merge --no-edit upstream/gemini-account-pool
git push origin HEAD
```

If Git reports a conflict, resolve it before pushing. Do not click the Deploy Button again.

</details>

#### Advanced: deploy the single-file Worker manually

Download `web2gem-account-pool-worker.js` from [Releases](https://github.com/Guardinary/web2gem/releases), paste it into a Cloudflare Worker, and add the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag. You must also bind a `GEMINI_DB` D1 database and configure `ADMIN_KEY`. See [Account Pool Management](#account-pool-management) for the database setup and account import steps.

![Cloudflare Worker settings showing nodejs_compat](./docs/images/cloudflare-worker-settings-nodejs-compat.png)

### Option 2: Deploy with Docker

Use [`.env.docker.example`](.env.docker.example) as the environment template and [`compose.yaml`](compose.yaml) as the Compose service definition:

```sh
cp .env.docker.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

On PowerShell, use `Copy-Item .env.docker.example .env` instead of `cp`.

The provided [`compose.yaml`](compose.yaml) pulls `ghcr.io/guardinary/web2gem-account-pool:latest` by default, maps `${PORT:-52389}:${PORT:-52389}`, and forwards the runtime variables from `.env`. Set `ADMIN_KEY`, plus `D1_ACCOUNT_ID`, `D1_DATABASE_ID`, and `D1_API_TOKEN`, so Docker can manage accounts and inject the required `GEMINI_DB` binding. Set `API_KEYS` for shared deployments. To pin a specific image tag, set `WEB2GEM_IMAGE=ghcr.io/guardinary/web2gem-account-pool:<tag>` in `.env`.

After the container starts, verify the local health route:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:52389/
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:52389/admin`, enter `ADMIN_KEY`, and import your first account.

If you changed `PORT` in `.env`, use that host port instead. Docker deployments default `UPSTREAM_SOCKET` to `false` in [`.env.docker.example`](.env.docker.example) because `cloudflare:sockets` is only available in the Cloudflare Workers runtime. Other runtime variables are the same as the configuration variables listed below.

For one-off local testing without Compose, you can still build and run the image directly:

```sh
docker build -t web2gem-account-pool .
docker run --rm -p 52389:52389 --env-file .env web2gem-account-pool
```

Release pages also provide prebuilt Docker image archives. Download the archive matching your platform, load it, and run the tagged image:

```sh
gzip -dc web2gem-account-pool_<tag>_docker_linux_amd64.tar.gz | docker load
docker run --rm -p 52389:52389 --env-file .env web2gem-account-pool:<tag>
```

If the upstream Gemini Web path starts returning empty output, first check whether `GEMINI_BL` needs to be refreshed from the current Gemini Web frontend. If Cloudflare egress is rate-limited, set `GEMINI_ORIGIN` to your own forwarding service or proxy endpoint.

## Differences from the main branch

`gemini-account-pool` is the persistent-storage edition of `web2gem`. It is released independently from `main`; the shared OpenAI-compatible and Google-compatible generation routes remain familiar, while account provisioning and operations use a different model.

Maintainers publish this edition from the default branch through **Actions → Release Account Pool Edition**. The shared control plane checks out `gemini-account-pool`, creates a `pool-v*` tag, and publishes the account-pool assets and container repositories from the captured revision.

| Area | `main` | `gemini-account-pool` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gemini credentials | Reads a directly configured Gemini cookie for the current runtime. | Stores multiple Gemini accounts in D1 and selects an available account for each generation request. |
| Persistence | Does not provide a persistent Gemini account store. | Persists account metadata, health state, cooldowns, refresh state, and coordination locks in `GEMINI_DB`. |
| Administration | No persistent account-pool console is required. | Provides the `/admin` WebUI and resource-oriented `/admin/accounts` API, protected by one `ADMIN_KEY`. |
| Deployment requirements | Can run without an account database. | Anonymous-eligible short text works without D1. Pro, long-context, attachment, image-generation, image-edit, and account-fallback paths require a configured D1 binding and a usable imported account. |
| Docker integration | Uses the standard Docker adapter and runtime environment. | Adds the D1 HTTP binding through `D1_ACCOUNT_ID`, `D1_DATABASE_ID`, and `D1_API_TOKEN`. |
| Runtime validation | Uses the main-branch configuration contract. | Applies strict boolean, integer, origin, filename, and `API_KEYS` validation. `ADMIN_KEY` is read as one ordinary string setting. Invalid value types fail with sanitized diagnostics. |
| Admin API | Not applicable to a persistent pool. | Uses `PATCH` / `DELETE /admin/accounts/:id` and `POST /admin/accounts/:id/refresh`; public `x-api-key` credentials never authorize admin operations. |

The production bundle also keeps Worker and Docker routing behind one application boundary and includes representative performance gates for streaming, socket parsing, and structured-output paths. These are branch-specific implementation differences and do not imply equivalent changes to `main`.

## Configuration

Configuration defaults live in `src/config/index.ts`. Cloudflare Worker environment variables / secrets and Docker environment variables override those defaults at runtime.

| Variable                        | Default                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `D1_DATABASE_ID`                | empty                       | Docker-only Cloudflare D1 database ID for the injected `GEMINI_DB` binding.                                                                                                                                      |

When managing a Worker through the Wrangler CLI, configure secrets with:

- Set `API_KEYS` for shared deployments. If it is empty, auth is disabled.
- Set `ADMIN_KEY` before using account-pool admin endpoints. Admin endpoints do not become public when this is missing.
- Bind the D1 database as `GEMINI_DB` and import Gemini accounts before serving account-required traffic such as Pro, long-context, attachment, or image requests.

```sh
wrangler secret put API_KEYS
wrangler secret put ADMIN_KEY
```

## Account Pool Management

The easiest way to get started is the built-in WebUI:

1. Open `https://your-worker.example/admin`.
2. Enter the configured `ADMIN_KEY` and choose session or local browser storage.
3. Import the bare values of `__Secure-1PSID` and `__Secure-1PSIDTS`.
4. Confirm the account appears as enabled and available.
5. Optionally reorder the internal Pro, Flash, and Flash Lite routes in the
   model-routing cards. Standard and `-extended` names share the same order.
6. Send a generation request through any supported API route.

Use a fresh or dedicated Gemini browser session when possible. Do not paste a full Cookie header, a browser cookie export, cookie names, equals signs, semicolons, or unrelated access tokens. The admin responses and account list are redacted and never return the stored session credentials.

This branch uses hybrid upstream routing. Eligible short text requests try anonymous Gemini Web first without reading D1. If anonymous generation fails before output, the provider can continue through distinct eligible accounts using `GEMINI_ACCOUNT_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default `10`, naturally capped by the pool). Pro, long-context, attachment, image-generation, and image-edit requests go directly to the same capability-aware failover path. Each account-scoped failure updates health before the failed account is excluded; authentication failures first receive one verified managed-cookie refresh attempt. Request-generated attachment and context refs are recreated under the replacement account, while externally supplied Gemini refs stay pinned to their original account. Streams switch only before the first non-empty delta. Missing authenticated-session capability returns HTTP 422 with `gemini_authenticated_session_required` and a machine-readable `reason`; an empty configured pool returns HTTP 503 with `no_available_gemini_account`, while a failed anonymous request keeps its original error when no fallback account exists.

For Workers, create a D1 database, apply [`migrations/0001_gemini_accounts.sql`](migrations/0001_gemini_accounts.sql), and bind it as `GEMINI_DB` in `wrangler.jsonc` or through your Cloudflare dashboard configuration. The final pre-release schema creates structured account, discovered-model capability, exact route-priority, metadata, and lock tables; stable PSID identity is required and unique from the first write.

For a new D1 database, apply the migration once:

```sh
wrangler d1 execute <database-name> --file migrations/0001_gemini_accounts.sql --remote
```

The account-pool schema is still development-only and has no compatibility migration. If you created a local database from an earlier revision, recreate it before applying the current `0001` migration.

For Docker, set all of `D1_ACCOUNT_ID`, `D1_DATABASE_ID`, and `D1_API_TOKEN` in `.env`. When all three are present, `server/docker-server.mjs` injects a D1-compatible `GEMINI_DB` binding backed by Cloudflare's D1 HTTP API. If only some are present, startup fails with a configuration error.

Worker account imports accept at most 40 accounts per admin request so native D1 work stays below the Workers Free per-invocation query limit. For larger imports, the built-in `/admin` UI first tries the complete batch and, only after the Worker returns the stable limit error, automatically retries sequentially in groups of 40 and aggregates the results. Direct admin API clients must split their own requests. Docker does not apply this account-count ceiling, so its initial UI request remains a single request; Docker imports are bounded by the shared 256 KiB admin request-body limit.

For automation, use the admin API under `/admin/accounts`. Requests require the configured `ADMIN_KEY` through `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or `X-Admin-Key`. Public `API_KEYS` and query-string `key` do not authorize these routes.

Default Gemini import accepts only bare cookie values:

```sh
curl -X POST "https://your-worker.example/admin/accounts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"provider":"gemini","accounts":[{"__Secure-1PSID":"<value-only>","__Secure-1PSIDTS":"<value-only>","label":"primary"}]}'
```

Duplicate imports are skipped safely. `GET /admin/accounts` accepts only `limit`, `cursor`, `q`, and `state`. It always returns the current page plus global `total`, `available`, `cooling`, `attention`, and `disabled` counts. Account summaries contain only identity, label, derived health state, the current normalized issue, cooldown, and core timestamps; cookie material and hashes never cross the admin boundary.

```sh
curl "https://your-worker.example/admin/accounts?state=attention&q=primary" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY"
```

The four UI states are derived rather than stored: disabled accounts are `disabled`, active cooldowns are `cooling`, durable authentication/user-action/location issues are `attention`, and all other selectable accounts are `available`. Runtime issues use only `auth`, `rate_limit`, `user_action`, `location`, or `transient`. A successful request or authenticated refresh clears the issue and cooldown; model/capability errors remain request-scoped and do not poison account health.

Model routing automation uses `GET /admin/model-routing`, `PUT
/admin/model-routing/{pro|flash|flash_lite}`, and `DELETE` on the same family
path to restore discovery order. PUT accepts an ordered `routes` array of exact
`providerModelId`, `capacity`, `capacityField`, and `modelNumber` tuples already
known to discovery or the saved policy. Invalid replacements leave the existing
policy and pool version unchanged.

Explicit refresh is admin-only:

```sh
curl -X POST "https://your-worker.example/admin/accounts/<account-id>/refresh" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY"
```

Every account mutation returns the same compact shape: `processed`, `changed`, `unchanged`, `failed`, and optional sanitized `errors`. Mutations never echo account rows. The WebUI also exposes only the discovered exact model routes needed for ordering; it never exposes credentials or raw RPC data. Health remains D1-free. Public model-list routes may read the persisted model catalog, but they never lease accounts, call `/app`, rotate cookies, or probe Google.

When importing accounts, use only the shortest supported credential form: `__Secure-1PSID` and `__Secure-1PSIDTS`. A fresh private-browser Gemini login that is closed after extracting these values tends to be more stable than copying a full everyday-browser cookie header.

For local development, use Wrangler environment support or pass bindings through the local Worker environment.

## Authentication

When `API_KEYS` is empty, public generation routes are callable without client authentication. Admin routes still require `ADMIN_KEY`. For any shared deployment, set at least one API key.

`web2gem` accepts:

- `Authorization: Bearer <key>`
- `x-api-key: <key>`
- `x-goog-api-key: <key>`

The health route `GET /` remains unauthenticated so deployment probes can work without secrets.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| `gemini_authenticated_session_required` | A Pro, long-context, attachment, or image request needs an authenticated Gemini session that this deployment has not configured. Inspect `reason`, then add the Worker D1 binding or all three Docker D1 credentials. |
| `no_available_gemini_account` | Direct account-required work found no selectable account. Open `/admin`; import an account, enable it, and check whether it is cooling down or needs refreshed credentials. |
| `invalid_runtime_config` | Review environment values. Booleans must be `true`/`false`, integers must be in range, and `ADMIN_KEY` must be one non-placeholder string. |
| Admin page returns 401 | Confirm the value sent by the WebUI matches `ADMIN_KEY`; public `API_KEYS` cannot authorize admin operations. |
| Docker exits before listening | Set `D1_ACCOUNT_ID`, `D1_DATABASE_ID`, and `D1_API_TOKEN` together, then inspect the container logs for the sanitized startup error. |
| Gemini returns empty output | Check whether `GEMINI_BL` still matches the current Gemini Web frontend. If Cloudflare egress is restricted, configure a compatible `GEMINI_ORIGIN`. |
| Image edit is rejected | Use inline base64/data URL or multipart image data. Remote `http://` and `https://` image URLs are intentionally not fetched. |

## Development

Authored source lives under `src/`. Do not hand-edit generated files under `dist/`.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm check:static
pnpm typecheck
pnpm check:arch
pnpm unit
pnpm smoke
```

The build script emits the production bundle plus an optional harness bundle:

| Bundle            | Source                   | Purpose                                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dist/worker.js`  | `src/index.ts`    | Canonical Worker artifact for Wrangler and Docker.           |
| `dist/harness.js` | `src/harness-exports.ts` | Smoke/bench harness bundle (built with `--harness-bundle`). |

## Testing

| Command             | Description                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm check:static` | Run Biome static analysis with warnings treated as errors.                                                                      |
| `pnpm check:worker-types` | Verify generated Cloudflare Worker binding types are current.                                                            |
| `pnpm typecheck`    | Run TypeScript with strict compiler settings.                                                                                   |
| `pnpm check:arch`   | Enforce import boundaries and detect source dependency cycles.                                                                  |
| `pnpm unit`         | Run local unit checks under `tests/unit/` with Vitest directly against `src/` sources - no build step.                          |
| `pnpm coverage`     | Write Vitest V8 lcov and JSON summary reports for `src/**` to `coverage/`.                                                       |
| `pnpm coverage:ci`  | Run Vitest V8 coverage with global thresholds plus critical-path line and branch coverage gates.                                |
| `pnpm smoke`        | Build both bundles, verify public exports, request-level routing checks, health route, and DSML tool-call parsing.              |
| `pnpm check:bench`  | Run the on-demand performance regression check against representative hot paths.                                                |
| `pnpm check:size`   | Build the production Worker and enforce the gzip bundle-size budget.                                                            |
| `pnpm docker:smoke` | Build the Docker image, run a temporary container, and verify health, auth, and OpenAI route behavior through the Node adapter. |

Vitest recursively discovers `tests/unit/**/*.test.ts`, which import `src/**` modules directly, so watch mode and coverage both work without a build step. `pnpm typecheck:tests` validates the test graph under the strict TypeScript baseline. Coverage uses Vitest's V8 provider over authored sources (lcov and JSON summary reports). `pnpm coverage` and `pnpm coverage:ci` use a Node runner so environment variables are handled consistently across Windows and Unix shells. `pnpm coverage:ci` also reads `coverage/coverage-summary.json` through `scripts/check-coverage.mjs` to catch regressions in key source directories and selected high-risk branch paths.

Recommended pre-commit gate:

```sh
pnpm check:static
pnpm typecheck
pnpm check:arch
pnpm unit
pnpm coverage:ci
pnpm smoke
# Optional when Docker is available:
pnpm docker:smoke
```

## Security Notice

This project adapts Gemini Web behavior and depends on upstream web protocol details that can change without notice. Use it for personal, research, or internal validation scenarios, and review the terms and risk profile of the upstream service before deploying it for shared use.

Never commit Gemini cookies or API keys. Store secrets in Cloudflare Worker secrets, Docker environment management, or another deployment-secret mechanism.
