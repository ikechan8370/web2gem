# Runtime Performance And Transport

## Scenario: Socket HTTP Transport

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing Gemini upstream transport, socket pooling, response body parsing, compression handling, or fetch fallback behavior.

### 2. Signatures

- `httpFetch(url, { method, headers, body, bodyLength, timeoutMs, socket, signal, cfg, acceptCompressed })` is the unified upstream entrypoint.
- `socketHttp(connect, url, { method, headers, body, bodyLength, timeoutMs, signal, keepAlive, pool, acceptCompressed })` owns HTTP/1.1 over `cloudflare:sockets`.
- `resolveSocketCompression(acceptCompressed)` constructs one request-local contract containing the advertised encoding and, only when supported and requested, the gzip decoder used for that response.
- `createSocketPool()`, `getDefaultSocketPool()`, and `closeIdleSocketPool(pool?)` own reusable idle sockets.
- `parseHttpChunkSizeLine(line: Uint8Array)` returns a safe integer chunk size or `-1`.

### 3. Contracts

- `httpFetch` should prefer socket transport when enabled and available, then fall back to `fetch` only for non-abort socket failures that occur before an upstream response status is exposed.
- Abort errors must not fall back to `fetch`; they must preserve request cancellation.
- Errors with upstream response metadata, such as `upstreamStatus`, must not fall back because the request may already have reached Gemini.
- `httpFetch` defaults socket `acceptCompressed` to `true` for `GET` and `false` for other methods unless explicitly provided.
- `socketHttp` sends `Accept-Encoding: gzip` only when `acceptCompressed` is true and `DecompressionStream("gzip")` is supported. Otherwise it sends `identity`.
- Resolve compression once before writing request headers. Missing, non-callable, or rejecting `DecompressionStream` constructors produce an identity contract; response decoding must use the same resolved contract rather than probing capability again.
- Streaming request bodies must provide a safe integer `bodyLength`. Socket transport uses it for `Content-Length` and writes chunks sequentially; fetch transport may use fixed-length Worker streams.
- Socket fallback with a streaming request body is allowed only before socket transport starts reading the body stream. Once the body stream has been read or written, do not retry through `fetch` because the body is no longer safely replayable.
- When a supported gzip response is decoded, remove `content-encoding` and `content-length` from the response headers exposed to callers.
- Unsupported or unsolicited compressed responses must remain raw bytes; do not construct unsupported decompression streams.
- Chunked response parsing must accept valid chunk extensions such as `5;foo=bar`, reject invalid hex, reject unsafe integer sizes, and tolerate split chunk-size lines across socket reads.
- `ByteQueue.readHttpChunkSizeLineIfAvailable()` must parse chunk-size digits incrementally while scanning for CRLF. Do not rescan and reparse the complete line after the terminator is found; long extensions may arrive one byte per socket read.
- Keep-alive sockets are pooled per origin, capped by `SOCKET_KEEP_ALIVE_MAX_IDLE_PER_ORIGIN`, and expire after `SOCKET_KEEP_ALIVE_IDLE_MS`.
- Every response-body reader owner must release its reader lock. Owners that
  terminate before normal EOF (parse failure, size limit, abort, or downstream
  iterator close) must attempt `reader.cancel()` before releasing the lock.
  Cleanup errors must not replace the primary return or exception. A normal EOF
  must release without canceling so a keep-alive response remains reusable.
- A caller that abandons an upstream response based only on status or headers
  must call `cancelResponseBody(response)` before retrying, throwing, or
  returning. This includes invalid-cookie generation responses, non-success
  account probes/uploads, and Cookie-rotation status paths. Cancellation failure
  must never replace the status-derived result.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- `cloudflare:sockets` unavailable -> `httpFetch` uses normal `fetch`.
- Socket connection/read/write error before upstream response status and request not aborted -> `httpFetch` logs safe metadata and falls back to `fetch`.
- Socket error with `upstreamStatus` metadata -> no fallback; propagate the socket error.
- `signal.aborted` or socket abort error -> throw abort, no fallback.
- `acceptCompressed=true`, gzip support present, gzip response -> caller sees decompressed body and no compression headers.
- `acceptCompressed=true`, gzip support absent -> request advertises `identity`; a gzip response remains raw.
- `acceptCompressed=false`, unsolicited gzip response -> response bytes and `content-encoding` / `content-length` remain unchanged.
- Chunk size line `5;foo=bar` -> parse as `5`.
- Chunk size line `a ;ext=1`, `Z`, or an unsafe integer -> stream error with `socket: invalid chunk size`.
- Status/header-only response path -> cancel the body once before preserving the
  existing retry, return, or error result.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: pass one resolved compression contract from request-header construction to response-body handling, then cover both supported decoding and raw-response paths.
- Good: cancel a non-success response body before refreshing credentials or
  recursively retrying the request.
- Base: socket transport preserves method, headers, body, timeout, auth cookies, model selection, and file references when falling back through `httpFetch`.
- Bad: fall back to anonymous or header-stripped fetch after a socket failure.
- Bad: send `Accept-Encoding: gzip` from socket code when the runtime cannot build a gzip `DecompressionStream`.
- Bad: parse chunk sizes with `parseInt(TEXT_DECODER.decode(line), 16)` without validating the full size token.
- Bad: return or throw from a status-only branch while leaving the response body
  unread and uncancelled.

### 6. Tests Required

- Unit test `parseHttpChunkSizeLine` for valid extensions, invalid hex, whitespace edge cases, and unsafe sizes.
- Unit test socket gzip decoding when `CompressionStream` and `DecompressionStream` are present.
- Unit test unsupported decompression behavior by patching `DecompressionStream` away and by using a constructor that rejects gzip.
- Unit test unsolicited gzip with `acceptCompressed=false` and assert raw bytes plus both compression headers remain intact.
- Unit test keep-alive reuse and expiry/cap behavior after changing socket pooling.
- Unit test reader lifecycle for normal EOF, read/parse failure, size limits,
  and early async-iterator close; assert both cancellation policy and unlocked
  bodies.
- Unit test status/header-only response branches and assert body cancellation
  without replacing the primary result when cancellation rejects.
- Unit test a long chunk extension split across one-byte queue pushes and assert the parsed size plus remaining body bytes.
- Run `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:arch`, `pnpm unit`, and `pnpm smoke` after changing transport fallback or socket response parsing.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
const sizeText = TEXT_DECODER.decode(line).trim().split(";")[0] || "";
const chunkSize = parseInt(sizeText, 16);
```

#### Correct

```typescript
const chunkSize = parseHttpChunkSizeLine(line);
if (chunkSize < 0) throw new Error("socket: invalid chunk size");
```

## Scenario: Runtime Benchmark Regression Gates

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when adding benchmark cases, changing hot-path algorithms, changing `scripts/bench.mjs`, or changing `scripts/check-benchmark.mjs`.

### 2. Signatures

- `BENCH_JSON=1 node scripts/bench.mjs` emits one JSON document with `{ iterations, warmup, filters, results }`.
- Each result contains `name`, `iterations`, `warmup`, `medianMs`, `p95Ms`, `p99Ms`, `meanMs`, `opsPerSec`, and optional `details`.
- `pnpm check:bench` gates a representative default case matrix.
- `BENCH_GATE_BUDGETS` may override the matrix with a JSON object mapping benchmark names to positive maximum median milliseconds.
- `BENCH_GATE_CASE` plus `BENCH_MAX_MEDIAN_MS` remains the explicit single-case compatibility mode.
- `BENCH_ACCOUNT_ADMIN_COUNT` controls the account-admin fixture population and
  defaults to 1000; the default overview case projects 200 rows and the bulk
  action case mutates 100 IDs.

### 3. Contracts

- Human-readable benchmark output remains the default for local investigation; the performance gate consumes machine-readable output.
- The default gate must cover more than one subsystem. It currently includes held tool sieving, cumulative stream extraction, split socket chunk-line parsing, structured-output uniqueness, account overview reads, and bulk account mutation orchestration.
- Every gated result must contain a finite numeric `medianMs`; missing, `null`, string, or non-finite values fail closed.
- Thresholds are absolute CI regression ceilings with hardware headroom, not claims about a specific workstation baseline.
- Default account-admin median ceilings are 0.1 ms for overview projection and
  0.5 ms for 100-ID bulk mutation orchestration.
- Intentional delay cases such as `sse_slow_consumer` remain observational and must not enter the CPU gate.
- Optimize only after repeated baseline runs. If an attempted fast path is slower, remove it instead of weakening the benchmark.
- `createStreamTextExtractor` may retain the complete previous raw value only while it is small enough for exact append comparison. For larger cumulative values, retain length plus bounded head/tail probes so prior large responses can be collected while append detection stays bounded.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Gated result is missing -> `Benchmark gate failed: missing benchmark median for <case>`.
- `medianMs` exceeds its case budget -> fail with measured and maximum formatted durations.
- `BENCH_GATE_BUDGETS` is malformed, empty, or contains non-positive values -> fail before running comparisons.
- Legacy text snapshot with an explicit input path -> parse the selected single-case median for compatibility.
- JSON output requested for one filtered case -> one parseable result with raw numeric millisecond fields.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: add a representative case, record repeated baselines, then add a threshold with CI headroom.
- Base: use `BENCH_CASES`, `BENCH_ITERS`, and `BENCH_WARMUP` for reproducible focused investigation.
- Bad: parse human-formatted microsecond/millisecond strings inside new gate logic when structured numeric output is available.
- Bad: gate the full benchmark suite or intentional timers, making normal validation slow and flaky.
- Bad: keep an algorithm change that only wins one noisy run or regresses behavior fixtures.

### 6. Tests Required

- Unit test machine-readable benchmark output with a fast filtered case.
- Unit test multi-case JSON gate success.
- Unit test benchmark fixture and default-budget changes through the scripts
  contract; keep the account-admin workload sizes aligned with production
  pagination and bulk-action bounds.
- Unit test a missing gated result and an over-budget result fail with the case name.
- Run `pnpm check:bench` after benchmark or hot-path changes.
- Run `pnpm unit` because script behavior is covered by `tests/unit/scripts.cases.mjs`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```javascript
const median = /median=([0-9.]+)ms/.exec(stdout)?.[1];
if (Number(median) > 20) process.exit(1);
```

#### Correct

```javascript
const results = parseBenchmarkResults(stdout);
for (const [name, maxMedianMs] of Object.entries(budgets)) {
  const medianMs = results.get(name)?.medianMs;
  if (!Number.isFinite(medianMs) || medianMs > maxMedianMs) fail(name);
}
```

## Scenario: Runtime Config And Bounded JSON Reads

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing environment config parsing, config cache keys, request body size guards, or JSON response helpers.

### 2. Signatures

- `CONFIG_SPEC` defines each static setting once as `{ key, field, defaultValue, parse }`.
- `CONFIG_ENV_KEYS`, parsing, and ordered cache snapshots are derived from `CONFIG_SPEC`.
- `getConfig(env)` returns a cached `StaticRuntimeConfig` only when current watched values match the stored snapshot.
- `assertRuntimeConfig(env)` validates the production bundle environment without exposing the internal config object.
- `RuntimeConfigError` contains safe `code`, `setting`, and `reason` fields and never includes the rejected value.
- `createRuntimeConfig(staticConfig, execution?, session?)` returns a new composed `RuntimeConfig` with request execution and account-session fields; it never mutates the cached static object.
- `requestContentLength(request)` returns a safe decimal byte length or `null`.
- `readJsonRequest(request, { maxBodyBytes, oversizedError })` reads UTF-8 JSON objects with optional bounded body size.
- `jsonTextResponse(body, status, extra)` returns an already-serialized JSON body.

### 3. Contracts

- Add every new environment-backed static setting as one typed `CONFIG_SPEC` entry; never maintain a parallel key/default/parser list.
- `ADMIN_KEY` is the single administrator credential and appears once in `CONFIG_ENV_KEYS`, deployment secret templates, and Compose forwarding. It accepts only one string; placeholder and overlong values are invalid.
- `API_KEYS` uses one comma-separated format. JSON-array strings, empty members, duplicates, and non-string array entries are invalid.
- Boolean settings accept only booleans or exact `"true"` / `"false"` strings. Integer settings accept only safe base-10 integers inside their documented bounds.
- `GEMINI_ORIGIN` must be an absolute HTTP(S) origin with no credentials, path, query, or fragment. Context attachment filenames are owner constants (`message.txt`, `tools.txt`), not `CONFIG_SPEC` / env keys.
- `StaticRuntimeConfig` contains only environment/default-derived values. `RuntimeExecutionContext` contains request-local `execution_ctx` and authenticated-session availability; `GeminiAccountSessionContext` contains cookie/SAPISID/account identity/writeback state.
- Parsed static config and its key arrays are frozen. Request/session composition must return a distinct object.
- The application composition root in `src/app.ts` must call `createRuntimeConfig(getConfig(env), executionContext)` before adding account-pool availability or acquiring a lease. Do not attach request/account fields directly to the cached object returned by `getConfig`.
- `GEMINI_COOKIE` and `SAPISID` are not public runtime config keys on the D1 account-pool branch. Do not add them back to `CONFIG_ENV_KEYS`; account leases populate `RuntimeConfig.cookie` and `RuntimeConfig.sapisid` internally after selecting a D1 account.
- The cache is one `WeakMap<WorkerEnv, { snapshot, value }>` keyed by env identity, but it must compare every derived snapshot value before returning the cached result.
- Store primitive watched values directly. Do not concatenate or serialize secret-bearing strings such as `ADMIN_KEY` or string-form `API_KEYS` on cache hits.
- Array-form `API_KEYS` uses a shallow content snapshot and invalidates after in-place replacement or length changes.
- `requestContentLength` accepts only safe base-10 integer strings after trimming; invalid, signed, fractional, or unsafe values return `null`.
- `readJsonRequest` must reject `Content-Length > maxBodyBytes` before reading the stream.
- When the streamed body exceeds `maxBodyBytes`, cancel the reader and return the configured 413 error before UTF-8 decoding or JSON parsing.
- If a valid `Content-Length` is present and within limit, preallocate that size; if the stream exceeds the declared length, fall back to chunk merging while still enforcing `maxBodyBytes`.
- Use `jsonTextResponse` when the caller already has a serialized JSON string and must avoid an extra `JSON.stringify`.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Reused env object changes `LOG_REQUESTS=false` to `LOG_REQUESTS=true` -> `getConfig` returns `true`.
- Composing two requests from one cached static config -> distinct runtime objects; neither request-local context appears on the cached static object.
- New env key used by config but missing from `CONFIG_ENV_KEYS` -> stale-cache bug; add the key and a cache regression test.
- `Content-Length: 1000`, `maxBodyBytes: 999` -> 413 before body read.
- Chunked body grows from 900 to 1001 bytes with `maxBodyBytes: 1000` -> cancel reader and return 413 using `1001 bytes > 1000`.
- Invalid `Content-Length: 01` or `+1` -> return `null` and use streamed byte accounting.
- Valid UTF-8 non-object JSON -> 400 `request body must be a JSON object`.
- Invalid UTF-8 -> 400 `invalid UTF-8 request body`.
- `LOG_REQUESTS=yes`, `RETRY_ATTEMPTS=0`, a path-bearing `GEMINI_ORIGIN`, or `API_KEYS=["key"]` -> `RuntimeConfigError` naming the setting and safe reason.
- Worker request with invalid config -> sanitized 500 `invalid_runtime_config` response with setting/reason and no rejected value.
- Docker CLI startup with invalid config -> reject before `server.listen(...)`.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: add `NEW_FEATURE_FLAG` once to `CONFIG_SPEC`; derive key watching, default selection, parsing, and snapshots from that entry.
- Good: call `createRuntimeConfig(staticConfig, { execution_ctx })` in `src/app.ts` and let account leases clone that runtime with session fields.
- Good: validate the built Worker module through `assertRuntimeConfig` before Docker starts listening.
- Base: use `requestContentLength(request)` for route-level body byte telemetry and oversized preflight checks.
- Bad: reuse `_configCacheValue` when `_configCacheEnv === env` without comparing the watched snapshot.
- Bad: build one serialized cache key containing copies of all watched secrets on every request.
- Bad: parse `Content-Length` with `Number(raw)` and accept signs, fractions, leading-zero variants, or unsafe integers.
- Bad: assign `execution_ctx`, `gemini_account`, or `cookie` onto an object returned by `getConfig`.
- Bad: silently clamp invalid integers, treat arbitrary truthy strings as booleans, or fall back from malformed JSON-array key text to comma parsing.

### 6. Tests Required

- Unit test that mutating and reusing one env object recomputes config.
- Unit test each new config env key through `getConfig`.
- Unit test strict boolean, integer, origin, and key-list failures plus secret redaction.
- Unit test `ADMIN_KEY` single-string parsing, placeholder rejection, and deployment example/Compose coverage.
- Unit test that static config remains unchanged after runtime/session composition and that empty runtime sessions receive empty cookie/SAPISID compatibility fields.
- Unit test Docker rejects invalid config before listening and Worker returns the sanitized error envelope.
- Unit test `requestContentLength` for valid, absent, malformed, and unsafe values.
- Unit test `readJsonRequest` preflight rejection from `Content-Length`.
- Unit test streamed body cancellation when bytes exceed `maxBodyBytes`.
- Run `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:arch`, `pnpm unit`, and `pnpm smoke` after changing request parsing or config wiring.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
if (_configCacheValue && _configCacheEnv === env) return _configCacheValue;
```

#### Correct

```typescript
const cached = CONFIG_CACHE.get(env);
if (cached && configSnapshotMatches(cached.snapshot, env)) return cached.value;
const value = parseStaticRuntimeConfig(env);
CONFIG_CACHE.set(env, { snapshot: captureConfigSnapshot(env), value });
return value;
```

#### Wrong

```typescript
const cfg = getConfig(env);
cfg.execution_ctx = ctx;
```

#### Correct

```typescript
const cfg = createRuntimeConfig(getConfig(env), { execution_ctx: ctx });
```

#### Wrong

```typescript
const enabled = /^(1|true|yes|on)$/i.test(String(env.LOG_REQUESTS));
const attempts = Math.max(1, Number.parseInt(String(env.RETRY_ATTEMPTS), 10));
```

#### Correct

```typescript
const cfg = getConfig(env); // throws RuntimeConfigError on malformed values
assertRuntimeConfig(env);   // production bundle validation for Docker startup
```

## Scenario: Worker Request And Image Resource Budgets

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing generation request parsing, inline Base64
decoding, multipart image edits, generated-image hydration, or deployment
defaults that affect Worker memory and CPU pressure.

### 2. Signatures

- `REQUEST_BODY_MAX_BYTES` maps to
  `StaticRuntimeConfig.request_body_max_bytes` and accepts integers from `1` to
  `104857600`.
- `readRouteJsonPost(request, cfg, path)` applies the JSON body budget before
  route handlers can acquire an account lease or call Gemini.
- `base64ToBytes(value)` supports strict standard Base64 and Base64URL input.
- `hydrateGeneratedImages(cfg, activeCfg, images, limits?)` defaults to `16 MiB`
  per generated image and `48 MiB` total decoded image bytes.

### 3. Contracts

- Authored Worker configuration defaults buffered generation JSON to `16 MiB`;
  Docker Compose defaults it to `64 MiB`. Explicit valid deployment values
  override both profiles.
- The JSON budget includes inline Base64 text because it limits the complete
  buffered request envelope before JSON parsing.

- Multipart image edits do not use `REQUEST_BODY_MAX_BYTES`. Their request
  capacity remains governed by `GENERIC_FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` plus the existing
  multipart form overhead.
- When the generic JSON limit is lower than the large-context inline limit,
  return `request_body_too_large`. When the large-context limit is lower or
  equal and text attachments are unavailable, return the more specific 422
  capability error: `gemini_authenticated_session_required` when authentication
  is missing, otherwise `large_context_inline_unsupported`.
- Declared oversized JSON must be rejected before reading the body. Streamed
  oversized JSON and generated-image responses must cancel their active reader.
- Compact Base64 should use native `Uint8Array.fromBase64` as the validation and
  decode authority when available. Preserve strict malformed-input rejection,
  Base64URL support, and the validated fallback for older runtimes.
- Generated-image hydration tracks decoded bytes, does not retry preview URLs
  after a budget failure, and preserves the source URL without Base64 when an
  individual or aggregate budget is exceeded.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- JSON `Content-Length` above `REQUEST_BODY_MAX_BYTES` -> HTTP 413
  `request_body_too_large` before D1 or Gemini work.
- Chunked JSON crosses the configured limit -> cancel the reader and return the
  route's OpenAI- or Google-compatible 413 envelope.
- Multipart image edit with a lower JSON limit -> ignore the JSON limit and use
  the multipart attachment limit.
- Malformed Base64 or Base64URL -> deterministic `invalid base64 payload`.
- Generated image `Content-Length` or streamed bytes exceed the remaining
  budget -> cancel, skip preview fallback, and return the original image URL.
- Invalid `REQUEST_BODY_MAX_BYTES` outside `1..104857600` -> sanitized
  `invalid_runtime_config` failure.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: tune Docker JSON capacity through `REQUEST_BODY_MAX_BYTES` without
  increasing the Worker-authored default.
- Base: a normal generated image hydrates to Base64 while remaining budgets are
  decremented by decoded byte length.
- Bad: apply the JSON envelope limit to multipart parsing or reduce
  `GENERIC_FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` as a substitute.
- Bad: call `response.bytes()` for generated images without content-length and
  incremental stream bounds.

### 6. Tests Required

- Test Worker `16 MiB`, Docker Compose `64 MiB`, maximum valid override, and
  invalid range values.
- Test OpenAI and Google declared oversized JSON before any D1 read.
- Test streamed JSON and image overflow cancellation.
- Test multipart image edits remain independent from the JSON limit.
- Test malformed standard Base64 and Base64URL in native and fallback modes.
- Test individual and aggregate generated-image budgets preserve URL-only output.
- Run `pnpm check:static`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:arch`, `pnpm unit`,
  `pnpm coverage:ci`, `pnpm smoke`, `pnpm check:bench`, and `pnpm check:size`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
const body = await response.bytes();
return bytesToBase64(body);
```

#### Correct

```typescript
const bytes = await responseBytes(response, remainingBytes);
remainingBytes -= bytes.byteLength;
return bytesToBase64(bytes);
```

## Scenario: Gemini Account Runtime Snapshot And Refresh Cost

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing the D1 Gemini account schema, issue/state
semantics, selectable snapshots, leases, outcome persistence, cookie refresh, or
account-scoped page/push-token caches.

### 2. Signatures

- `GeminiAccountStore.listSelectableAccounts(nowMs, limit)` returns only
  `id`, `enabled`, `cookie_header`, `cookie_hash`, `issue`,
  `cooldown_until_ms`, and `last_used_at_ms`.
- `GeminiAccountStore.writeAccountOutcome(accountId, outcome)` accepts a
  success or a failure with an optional normalized issue and cooldown.
- `GeminiAccountStore.writeRefreshedCookie(accountId, { cookieHeader,
  refreshedAtMs, nowMs })` returns `{ changed, reason?: "duplicate_cookie" }`.
- `AccountPoolService.acquireLease(baseConfig, { excludeAccountIds? })` returns
  one unexcluded account lease or `null`; a successful refresh updates that
  lease's active `config`.
- Persisted issues are `auth | rate_limit | user_action | location | transient`.
  Public states are `available | cooling | attention | disabled`.

### 3. Contracts

- `migrations/0001_gemini_accounts.sql` owns the compatibility-free initial
  schema. The account table has exactly identity/label, `enabled`, normalized
  Cookie plus unique hash, one issue/cooldown, issue/use/refresh timestamps, and
  create/update timestamps. Retain pool metadata and refresh locks.
- `enabled` is the only operator-controlled availability state. Never persist
  presentation state, category, counters, capability placeholders, source
  metadata, row aliases, page tokens, push IDs, or per-account transport
  overrides.
- Derive state in this order: disabled, active cooldown, durable issue, available.
  Suppress an expired `rate_limit` or `transient` issue from public summaries.
- `auth`, `user_action`, and `location` block durably. `rate_limit` uses a
  five-minute cooldown; `transient` uses one minute. Model-invalid and
  capability-mismatch errors are request-scoped and update only last use.
- Success clears issue/cooldown/issue time. Publish `pool_version` only when a
  health transition changes selectability; healthy last-use updates must not
  invalidate every isolate snapshot.
- Cookie refresh normalizes away `SNlM0e`, `session_token`, and `at`, checks
  duplicate ownership before and after the D1 update, clears health after an
  authenticated success, and atomically publishes pool version.
- A duplicate-cookie refresh leaves the lease/config unchanged. A successful
  refresh updates `lease.cookieHeader`, `lease.cookieHash`, and
  `lease.config.cookie/sapisid/gemini_account.cookieHash` together.
- `/app` page tokens and content-push `push_id` stay in account-scoped runtime
  caches. They are not D1 account columns and never enter the lease response
  Cookie observer; only raw `Set-Cookie` header values cross that callback.
- Snapshot caching, pending refresh dedupe, lock ownership, and cache keys use
  account IDs/hashes, never credentials.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Disabled row, active cooldown, durable issue, or request-local excluded ID ->
  excluded from selection.
- Expired temporary issue -> selectable and publicly `available` with
  `issue: null`.
- Model/capability error -> no issue/cooldown mutation.
- 401/403 refresh rejection -> `auth`; 429 -> `rate_limit`; unknown
  network/5xx failure -> `transient`.
- Same-cookie authenticated refresh -> `unchanged`, health cleared, refresh
  timestamp recorded.
- Cookie hash owned by another account, including a convergence race ->
  `rotation_duplicate`, no lease mutation and no failure outcome.
- D1 lock conflict -> typed unchanged result and no rotate call.
- Successful outcome persistence rejection -> preserve the upstream result and
  handle the persistence rejection safely.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `domain.ts` owns issue/state guards and derivation; storage and admin
  projection reuse it.
- Good: register pending refresh by `accountId + cookieHash` before the first
  await and update the active lease config after writeback.
- Base: an empty selectable snapshot is cached and version-probed like any other
  snapshot.
- Bad: storing a mutable status enum beside `enabled` and cooldown.
- Bad: writing page tokens, push IDs, counters, or category back to D1.
- Bad: bumping pool version for every healthy request merely because
  `last_used_at_ms` changed.

### 6. Tests Required

- State precedence, durable/temporary issue guards, and expired-issue
  suppression.
- Outcome classification for auth/rate/user-action/location/transient and
  request-scoped model errors.
- Selection exclusion, request-local attempted-ID exclusion, success recovery,
  local snapshot updates, and transition-only pool-version publication.
- Refresh pending dedupe, D1 lock conflict, same-cookie success, duplicate
  preflight/race handling, rejection classification, and active lease-config
  replacement.
- Account-scoped page/push-token cache isolation and absence of D1 page-state
  writeback.
- Run `pnpm check:static`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:arch`,
  `pnpm unit`, `pnpm coverage:ci`, and `pnpm smoke`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
row.status = "rate_limited";
await store.writePageState(accountId, { at, pushId });
```

#### Correct

```typescript
await store.writeAccountOutcome(accountId, {
  kind: "failure",
  issue: "rate_limit",
  cooldownUntilMs: nowMs + 5 * 60_000,
  nowMs,
});
// Page/push tokens remain in the account-scoped runtime cache.
```

## Scenario: Atomic Account-Pool Version Publication

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing D1 account create/update/delete behavior, Cookie
writeback, selection-affecting account outcomes, `pool_version`, or the Docker D1
HTTP binding.

### 2. Signatures

- `D1GeminiAccountStore.getPoolVersion()` returns the opaque numeric string used
  by `AccountPoolService` to detect stale selectable snapshots.
- `D1DatabaseLike.batch(statements)` is the production transaction primitive for
  native Worker D1 and Docker's Cloudflare D1 HTTP adapter.
- `createD1HttpBinding(...).batch(statements)` serializes same-binding prepared
  statements as `{ batch: [{ sql, params }] }` to the D1 REST `/query` endpoint.

### 3. Contracts

- `pool_version` is a strictly increasing numeric string. Increment the value
  already stored in D1; never assign `String(nowMs)` as the version.
- Existing timestamp-shaped numeric versions are valid starting values and need
  no migration. Runtime consumers compare versions as opaque strings and must not
  parse or sort them.
- Create, update, delete, Cookie writeback, and outcomes that change status or
  cooldown must execute the account mutation plus a conditional version increment
  in one `batch()` transaction.
- The conditional single-row increment uses SQLite `changes() > 0`. A missing-row
  or no-op mutation does not publish invalidation.
- Success/failure counters and other outcome metadata that do not affect account
  selection do not increment `pool_version`.
- If `batch` is absent on a compatibility D1-like adapter, run the mutation first
  and increment only after a changed result. Production Worker and Docker bindings
  must expose `batch`.
- Docker batch statements must come from the same HTTP binding instance. Batch
  errors may include a result index or sanitized Cloudflare code, but never SQL
  bind values, Cookies, session tokens, authorization headers, or D1 API tokens.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Two writes with the same `nowMs` -> two distinct increasing versions.
- Existing version `1700000000000` plus one write -> `1700000000001`.
- Account mutation fails -> transaction rolls back; version unchanged.
- Version increment fails -> account mutation rolls back.
- Cookie-hash uniqueness race -> update and increment roll back; duplicate owner
  is re-read; return the existing duplicate no-op result.
- HTTP batch returns the wrong result count or a failed member -> sanitized
  `D1HttpBindingError`; no request secrets in the message.
- Statement from another HTTP binding -> reject before sending a network request.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: batch `[accountMutation, incrementWhereChangesPositive]` and return the
  first statement result.
- Good: keep `updated_at_ms` monotonic with `MAX(existing, incoming)` while the
  version itself increments independently of wall-clock collisions.
- Base: a D1-like test or compatibility adapter without `batch` uses the existing
  sequential fallback and cannot claim transaction atomicity.
- Bad: write the account row, then issue an independent timestamp assignment to
  `pool_version`.
- Bad: serialize arbitrary prepared-statement objects or cross-binding statements
  through the Docker HTTP adapter.

### 6. Tests Required

- Assert same-millisecond creates increment an existing timestamp-shaped version
  twice.
- Inject version-publication failure and assert the account row and version both
  roll back.
- Assert duplicate Cookie convergence preserves the original row and version.
- Assert HTTP batch request shape, ordered result mapping, empty batches,
  cross-binding rejection, malformed result counts, failed members, and secret-safe
  messages.
- Run `pnpm check:static`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:arch`, `pnpm unit`,
  `pnpm coverage:ci`, and `pnpm smoke`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
await mutation.run();
await setPoolVersion(String(nowMs));
```

#### Correct

```typescript
await db.batch([
  mutation,
  incrementPoolVersion("WHERE changes() > 0"),
]);
```

## Scenario: D1 Batch Account Import


### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing Gemini account creation, batch import limits,
D1 insert/query shape, pool-version updates, or Worker/Docker import behavior.

### 2. Signatures

- `GeminiAccountAdminStore.createAccountsBulk?(entries)` accepts unique
  `{ cookieHash, identityHash, input }` entries and returns canonical
  `itemsByCookieHash`, `createdAccountIds`, and
  `changedCredentialCookieHashes` as separate facts.
- `GeminiAccountAdminStore.importAccountByIdentity?(entry)` is the required
  one-by-one primitive when the bulk method is absent. It returns one canonical
  item and an explicit `created | credentials_changed | unchanged` outcome.
- `D1GeminiAccountStore.createAccountsBulk(entries)` is the native D1 owner.
- `normalizeCreateAccounts(body, maxAccounts)` enforces the runtime-specific
  account-count ceiling before cookie hashing or store access.
- `ApplicationExecutionContext.runtimeProfile` is `"docker"` only for the Node
  adapter; application runtime config normalizes it to `runtime_profile`.

### 3. Contracts

- Workers accept at most 40 accounts per admin import. A 40-account all-new
  import uses 40 identity-conflict-aware upsert statements, one canonical
  identity lookup query, and one conditional pool-version update: 42 D1
  statements total.
- Docker has no account-count ceiling. It remains bounded by the shared 256 KiB
  admin request-body limit, writes accounts in transactional groups of at most
  40, and reconstructs canonical rows in chunks of at most 100 identity-hash
  bind parameters.
- The Docker distinction is request-local adapter metadata, not a public
  environment variable or user-controlled HTTP header.
- Normalize and hash each input, collapse duplicate identity hashes before store
  access, and retain the original input count for the compact mutation result.
- D1 imports use `ON CONFLICT(identity_hash) DO UPDATE` with a
  credential-hash change predicate; a duplicate full Cookie under another
  identity remains a unique-constraint error and is never merged silently. A
  native batch rolls its leading version write and every account upsert in that
  group back together when any statement fails.
- Native Worker D1 and Docker's HTTP adapter use `db.batch(statements)`.
  D1-compatible adapters without `batch` execute the same prepared statements
  sequentially.
- In a native batch, the conditional `pool_version` statement is the first
  statement. Under the D1 write transaction it counts which requested
  `(identity_hash, cookie_hash)` pairs already exist before the upserts; it
  publishes once when that count is short, then the identity upserts execute in
  the same transaction. This prevents concurrent stale-snapshot double bumps
  and rolls the version write back if an upsert fails. The JSON CTE uses three
  binds for the leading statement: the serialized identity/cookie pair list,
  the `pool_version` key, and `nowMs`; pair values are not expanded into
  individual placeholders, so the 40-row group remains below D1's parameter
  limit.
- The leading statement's `RETURNING preexisting_ids` payload records the
  identity-to-canonical-ID state before the following upserts. Use that
  prestate together with each upsert's changed-row metadata to classify
  `created` versus `credentials_changed`; after the batch, re-read canonical
  rows by stable identity. Do not infer mutations from final Cookie hashes,
  timestamps, or candidate-ID equality: an unchanged re-import may share the
  request clock and a changed identity must retain its canonical ID.
- D1-compatible adapters without `batch` preflight identities, execute upserts
  sequentially, and publish one version increment after inspecting real
  changed-row results; this fallback is not a cross-statement transaction and
  recovers canonical rows by stable identity after each import.
- Every import statement must report a recognized non-negative changed-row
  count in D1 metadata. An adapter that omits this metadata fails explicitly;
  import classification must not apply the generic mutation fallback that
  assumes an unknown result changed one row.
- A changed upsert with an absent pre-upsert identity is `created`; a changed
  upsert with an existing pre-upsert identity is `credentials_changed`. A
  zero-change upsert is `unchanged`. The canonical identity ID is never
  replaced.
- Stores without `createAccountsBulk` must implement
  `importAccountByIdentity`; missing capability or an unknown outcome fails
  explicitly instead of falling back to cookie-hash preflight/create behavior.
  Worker validation still applies the same count cap before hashing or store
  calls.
- The built-in admin UI submits the full import first. It retries sequentially
  in groups of 40 only after HTTP 413
  `gemini_import_account_limit_exceeded`; direct API callers retain the explicit
  per-request ceiling, and Docker avoids chunking when the first request succeeds.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Worker payload with 41 accounts -> HTTP 413
  `gemini_import_account_limit_exceeded`, zero hashes and zero D1 access.
- Docker payload with more than 40 accounts and at most 256 KiB -> process it;
  do not return the Worker count-limit error.
- Admin UI payload with more than 40 accounts on Worker -> one rejected full
  request followed by ordered requests of at most 40; merge successful results.
- Admin UI import with any other error -> no automatic retry.
- Existing identity with the same credential -> canonical unchanged item, no
  compact changed count, no pool-version publish, and no import probe.
- Existing identity with a new credential -> preserve canonical ID, update the
  credential, increment compact changed once, publish the group version once,
  and do not schedule an import probe.
- Concurrent same-identity imports -> exactly one mutation outcome; every caller
  re-reads the same canonical identity row.
- Post-import identity lookup lacks an expected row -> fail with a generic
  internal admin error; never include Cookie values or hashes in the response.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: 40 Worker imports run through one 41-statement `batch()` call (the
  leading conditional version statement plus 40 upserts) and one canonical
  identity read: 42 D1 statements total.
- Good: 101 Docker imports use three bounded upsert groups plus two
  100-parameter-bounded reconstruction queries.
- Base: duplicate input identities collapse before storage; original input count
  still drives compact `processed`, while only a real creation or credential
  rotation contributes to `changed`.
- Bad: perform `findAccountByCookieHash` plus `createAccount` plus a version bump
  for every D1-backed input.
- Bad: apply the 40-account Worker ceiling to Docker or expose a public runtime
  profile environment setting.

### 6. Tests Required

- Assert 40 all-new Worker accounts produce one native 41-statement batch, 42
  recorded D1 statements, and one pool-version update.
- Assert 41 Worker accounts fail before any D1 statement.
- Assert the Docker adapter marks its execution context and a 101-account Docker
  import uses three batches, three version increments, and two reconstruction
  queries.
- Assert a D1-like adapter without `batch` still imports accounts and increments
  once per changed group.
- Assert missing or malformed changed-row metadata fails explicitly instead of
  classifying an unchanged import as a credential change.
- Assert mixed existing/new/in-payload identities preserve compact counts and
  canonical mappings.
- Assert all-unchanged imports do not update the pool version even when the
  stored `updated_at_ms` equals the import clock.
- Assert concurrent same-identity batches serialize their leading pair-count
  predicate so only the first mutation publishes a version.
- Assert a store without bulk capability requires the explicit identity import
  primitive and validates its three-state outcome.
- Assert the admin UI retries only the stable Worker limit error in ordered
  40-account chunks, keeps Docker to one request, and preserves merged items.
- Search complete response JSON for Cookie/session fragments and run
  `pnpm check:static`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:arch`, `pnpm unit`,
  `pnpm coverage:ci`, and `pnpm smoke`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
for (const input of inputs) {
  if (!(await store.findAccountByCookieHash(input.cookieHash))) {
    await store.createAccount(input);
  }
}
```

#### Correct

```typescript
const entries = Array.from(uniqueEntries.values());
const stored = this.adminStore.createAccountsBulk
  ? await this.adminStore.createAccountsBulk(entries)
  : await createAccountsOneByOne(this.adminStore, entries);
await this.scheduleImportedAccountProbes([...stored.createdAccountIds]);
```

## Scenario: Account-aware Gemini Provider Lease And Caches

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when wiring `AccountPoolService` into `src/gemini/completion-provider.ts`, changing provider request lifecycle behavior, changing Gemini upload/page-token caches, or changing generated-image byte fetching in account-pool mode.

### 2. Signatures

- `createGeminiCompletionProvider(cfg, { accountPool })` returns a request-scoped provider.
- Account-backed `RuntimeConfig` carries `gemini_account.accountId`,
  `gemini_account.cookieHash`, and an optional internal `observeSetCookie`
  callback plus the selected Cookie/SAPISID runtime values. The callback stages
  trusted response Cookie headers in memory; it does not expose D1 or write on
  the upstream response path.
- `CompletionProvider.supportsAuthenticatedSession` is the provider-neutral signal that authenticated Gemini behavior is available through a configured account pool. Low-level cookie-shaped configs may still appear after a D1 account lease is selected.
- `CompletionProvider.dispose()` releases an acquired request lease when preparation fails before generation.

### 3. Contracts

- Public auth and JSON/multipart request validation must happen before account lease acquisition or D1 account reads. Constructing a runtime object is allowed before parsing, but `acquireLease` and store reads must stay lazy.
- A provider instance keeps at most one active account lease at a time and reuses
  it across `resolveAttachments`, `uploadTextFile`, and the generation attempt
  that consumes their refs. One request may acquire at most three distinct
  leases after account-scoped failures, excluding every previously failed ID.
- Upload-only provider calls keep the lease for the later generation call. If preparation returns an error after upload/bootstrap, the HTTP handler must call `provider.dispose()` before returning.
- Non-streaming generation marks account success only after the Gemini call resolves. Streaming marks success only after the async iterator completes normally.
- If a downstream consumer closes the account-backed async iterator early,
  cancel the nested stream through iterator close, release the current lease,
  and reset request-local attempt/upload state. Consumer close is neutral: it
  must not persist success or failure and must release the lease exactly once.
- Non-abort provider failures mark the selected account failure and release the
  lease. Failover is allowed only when the shared classifier returns a normalized
  account issue. Abort/disconnect and request-scoped model/capability errors do
  not acquire another account.
- Authentication failures attempt `lease.refreshForRetry("auth")` once for the
  selected account. A changed credential retries that account before failover.
- Managed-account client calls do not spend generic same-account retry delays;
  anonymous calls retain the configured retry behavior and explicit build-label
  repair remains allowed.
- Terminal outcomes update the isolate-local snapshot before durable persistence,
  so an auth-failed or cooling account is not immediately selected again locally.
- Account outcome persistence is auxiliary state management. Its rejection must
  never replace a successful upstream result, replace the original upstream
  failure, or enter the success path's failure classifier.
- Guard every outcome promise with a safe rejection handler. Register the guarded
  promise with `execution_ctx.waitUntil` when available; otherwise await the
  guarded promise for deterministic non-Worker callers. Release the local lease
  before waiting or returning.
- Anonymous eligibility is decided at the provider boundary from the resolved
  model, rendered prompt bytes, file references, operation kind, and existing
  lease state. Reuse `CURRENT_INPUT_FILE_MIN_BYTES` and the bounded UTF-8 prompt
  helpers; do not inspect raw HTTP `Content-Length` for this decision.
- Short text requests with no file references, no image operation, prompt bytes
  at or below the configured threshold, and a non-Pro model call Gemini with an
  empty Cookie/SAPISID config before acquiring an account.
- Pro mode (`modeId === 3`), oversized prompts, uploaded or existing file refs,
  image generation, and image editing are account-required and never attempt
  anonymous generation.
- An anonymous non-abort error or empty response may enter the same bounded
  three-account path. Streaming may do this only before its first non-empty
  delta. If lease acquisition cannot start because the runtime is absent or the
  pool is empty, preserve the original anonymous error.
- Request-generated attachment, `message.txt`, and `tools.txt` uploads retain
  source recipes. After switching accounts, replay every successful recipe and
  immutably remap old refs to refs created by the new account. An externally
  supplied Gemini ref without a recipe prevents cross-account failover.
- No eligible account for direct account-required work must throw a sanitized
  503 error with code `no_available_gemini_account` and must not call anonymous
  upstream Gemini.
- Account-marked configs must not use the process-global single-cookie rotation singleton. Cookie/session recovery goes through account runtime leases.
- `/app` page tokens and content-push `push_id` caches must include account identity or cookie hash when `gemini_account` is present. Build-label cache remains origin-scoped.
- Raw cookies, `SNlM0e`, `at`, `SAPISID`, session tokens, SQL bind values, and D1 API tokens must not appear in cache keys, log fields, or public error messages.
- Successful `/app` token bootstrap updates only the account-scoped page/push-token caches. It must not write page tokens or push IDs into D1 or outbound Cookie headers.
- `createOriginScopedStringCache.setCached` must isolate a synchronous
  `execution_ctx.waitUntil` registration failure from the fresh value. The
  background write promise remains self-guarded; non-Worker callers still await
  that guarded promise.
- Content-push upload may send selected `Push-ID`, but must not send Gemini `Cookie` or SAPISID-derived `Authorization` to `content-push.googleapis.com`.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Auth failure with `GEMINI_DB` configured -> 401 and zero D1 `prepare` calls.
- Invalid JSON with `GEMINI_DB` configured -> 400 and zero D1 `prepare` calls.
- Missing `GEMINI_DB` plus eligible short text -> anonymous upstream generation,
  zero D1 reads.
- Missing `GEMINI_DB` plus Pro, attachment, oversized, or image work -> 422
  `gemini_authenticated_session_required` with the matching `reason`, zero
  anonymous upstream calls.
- D1 configured with no selectable account plus eligible short text -> anonymous
  success when upstream succeeds; after anonymous failure, preserve that error.
- D1 configured with no selectable account plus direct account-required work ->
  503 `no_available_gemini_account`, zero upstream Gemini calls.
- Anonymous error before output plus selectable accounts -> try at most three
  distinct accounts and record each attempted account's outcome.
- Account A returns a normalized account issue before output -> persist A's
  outcome, release A, acquire B with A excluded, replay generated uploads, and
  retry through B.
- Account A returns a model/capability error, request aborts, or a stream has
  emitted output -> release/finalize A without acquiring B.
- All three accounts fail -> release each lease exactly once and preserve the
  third account's meaningful upstream error.
- Anonymous abort or stream error after a non-empty delta -> no account lease.
- Upload then generation -> one lease acquisition, same account config in both calls, one success, one release.
- `/app` page token fetch for account A then account B -> distinct cache keys; tokens cannot cross accounts.
- Fresh build-label or push-ID fetch plus synchronous `waitUntil` throw -> return
  the fresh value and log registration failure; do not convert it into an
  upstream/cache error.
- Account stream yields a first delta -> no success marked yet; stream completion -> success and release.
- Account stream throws after partial output -> failure and release; no alternate-account retry after visible output.
- Account stream consumer calls `return()` after a delta -> nested stream closes,
  lease releases once, and neither success nor failure is persisted.
- Successful generation plus D1 outcome rejection -> preserve the generated
  result, release once, and handle the background rejection.
- Upstream generation failure plus D1 outcome rejection -> preserve the original
  upstream error, release once, and do not record the D1 error as an account
  failure.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: provider coordinator stores one active lease, an attempted-ID set, and
  upload recipes; it releases a failed lease before acquiring an untried one.
- Good: wrap the complete async-generation attempt loop in an idempotent
  `finally` that performs only neutral cleanup when no terminal outcome ran.
- Good: create one guarded outcome promise, release the lease, then pass the
  guarded promise to `waitUntil`.
- Good: HTTP prepare-error branches call `provider.dispose()` before returning a validation error after possible upload work.
- Good: generated-image byte hydration receives the same account-backed config as rich generation.
- Good: eligible text reaches anonymous upstream without calling
  `AccountPoolService.acquireLease`; a pre-output failure then uses the normal
  least-in-flight/round-robin selector once.
- Base: no-D1 eligible text remains usable anonymously, while account-required
  work fails closed with `gemini_authenticated_session_required`; static health/model
  routes still do not read D1.
- Bad: acquire an account before the final prompt, model, and file references are
  known, because that defeats anonymous preference and consumes pool capacity.
- Bad: retry through an account after a streamed delta, which duplicates visible
  output.
- Bad: place lease cleanup only after the `for await` loop; consumer `return()`
  skips that continuation.
- Bad: calling `AccountPoolService.acquireLease` while parsing JSON, checking public API keys, listing models, or serving health checks.
- Bad: keying page tokens or push IDs by raw cookie header.
- Bad: call `execution_ctx.waitUntil(write)` without guarding its synchronous
  registration path.
- Bad: releasing the lease immediately after successful upload and selecting another account for generation.
- Bad: await `markSuccess()` inside the generation `try` with an unguarded
  rejection; a persistence failure then enters the upstream failure branch.

### 6. Tests Required

- Provider unit tests for lease reuse across upload plus text/rich generation,
  A-to-B success, three-account exhaustion, and exclusion propagation.
- Provider tests for threshold equality vs threshold-plus-one, both Pro models,
  uploaded/existing refs, and rich image operations.
- Provider tests for anonymous preference with no D1/empty D1, anonymous error
  and empty-response fallback, original-error preservation when acquisition
  fails, and abort exclusion.
- Stream tests for fallback before output, empty-stream fallback, and no fallback
  after a delta or abort.
- Provider stream tests for success only after iterator completion, release on
  stream failure, and neutral release on consumer `return()`.
- Provider tests proving `waitUntil` registration, successful-result
  preservation, original-error preservation, handled intermediate/terminal
  outcome-write rejection, auth refresh, recipe replay/ref remapping, and opaque
  ref pinning.
- Runtime test proving a terminal auth failure immediately removes the account
  from the local selectable set.
- Route tests proving auth and request-validation failures do not touch D1.
- Cache tests proving account-scoped page-token and push-id isolation.
- Upload tests proving content-push requests omit Cookie and Authorization.
- Runtime/cache tests proving page tokens and push IDs are account-scoped, never written to D1, and never added to outbound Cookie headers.
- Runtime/cache tests proving synchronous background registration failure does
  not replace a successful fresh value, while asynchronous write rejection is
  still logged.
- Run `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:arch`, `pnpm check:static`, `pnpm unit`, and `pnpm smoke`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
const activeCfg = await acquireAccountConfig();
return generate(activeCfg, input);
```

#### Correct

```typescript
if (!accountRequired(cfg, model, input, hasLease)) {
  return generateAnonymousThenAccountFallback(input);
}
return generateWithAccountLease(input);
```

#### Wrong

```typescript
const result = await generate(activeCfg);
await lease.markSuccess();
lease.release();
return result;
```

#### Correct

```typescript
const result = await generate(activeCfg);
const guarded = lease.markSuccess().catch((error) => logSafe(error));
lease.release();
cfg.execution_ctx?.waitUntil(guarded);
return result;
```

#### Wrong

```typescript
await lease.markFailure(error);
lease.release();
throw error;
```

#### Correct

```typescript
attemptedAccountIds.add(lease.accountId);
await guardOutcome(lease.markFailure(error));

const next = await runtime.acquireLease(cfg, {
  excludeAccountIds: attemptedAccountIds,
});
await replayRequestGeneratedUploads(next);
return retryWithRemappedRefs(next);
```

## Scenario: Streaming Delta Coalescing

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing completion stream event helpers, OpenAI or Google streaming writers, SSE pacing, or small-delta performance behavior.

### 2. Signatures

- `streamPlainCompletionEvents(provider, input, { signal })` emits provider text as completion events without buffering.
- `streamToolSieveCompletionEvents(..., { signal })` and `streamSievedTextDeltas(..., { signal }, ctx)` accept provider-supported options only.
- `createDeltaCoalescer(sendDeltaFrame, minFlushChars = 64, maxFlushWaitMs = 20, { emitFirstImmediately })` is the single streaming delta buffer.
- `MIN_DELTA_FLUSH_CHARS` and `MAX_DELTA_FLUSH_WAIT_MS` are the protocol-frame defaults.

### 3. Contracts

- Completion forwards provider delta boundaries unchanged while preserving abort/error conversion, tool sieving, lifecycle reduction, and token accounting.
- HTTP protocol writers own the only timer-bearing coalescer because they understand protocol fields and terminal frame ordering.
- Protocol writers use `createDeltaCoalescer(..., { emitFirstImmediately: true })` when user-visible first-token latency matters.
- A non-abort provider error is classified after every already-yielded provider delta has reached the protocol writer; aborts are rethrown without a warning or synthetic final delta.
- Always await `append(...)` and `flush()` before switching fields, writing a finish frame, or closing the stream.
- Do not reintroduce completion-level size/time buffering; stacking two 64-character / 20-ms buffers adds latency without reducing final protocol writes.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Provider yields `["he", "llo"]` -> completion emits two text events; the HTTP coalescer may emit `he` immediately and flush `llo` later.
- Many tiny provider deltas -> the HTTP writer emits fewer frames at 64 code points, 20 ms, or final flush.
- Provider throws after text -> emitted text is preserved, then warning/error handling runs.
- Provider aborts after text -> abort propagates without a warning/error event or synthetic flush.
- Delta field changes -> flush the previous field before buffering the new field.
- Finish frame written before awaited `flush()` -> ordering bug.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses, and Google writers share `createDeltaCoalescer`.
- Base: completion exposes lifecycle events and HTTP decides frame pacing.
- Bad: add `coalesceTextDeltas` or a timer under `src/completion/`.
- Bad: call `append()` or `flush()` without awaiting it.

### 6. Tests Required

- Unit-test completion event boundaries and warning/abort behavior.
- Unit-test `createDeltaCoalescer` threshold, timer, field-change, first-immediate, and awaited-final-flush behavior.
- Route tests must preserve OpenAI/Google finish frames, warnings, tool calls, and usage.
- Run `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:arch`, `pnpm unit`, `pnpm coverage:ci`, and `pnpm smoke`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
for await (const event of streamPlainCompletionEvents(provider, input, { signal })) {
  await completionTimerBuffer.append(event);
}
```

#### Correct

```typescript
for await (const event of streamPlainCompletionEvents(provider, input, { signal })) {
  if (event.type === "text_delta") await coalescer.append("content", event.text);
}
await coalescer.flush();
```

## Scenario: Attachment Dedupe And In-Flight Memory

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing request-local attachment materialization, deduplication, upload concurrency, or attachment memory limits.

### 2. Signatures

- `mapWithConcurrencyAndWeight(items, concurrency, maxWeight, weightOf, mapper)` preserves input ordering while limiting item count and aggregate active weight.
- Attachment uploads use four workers and a 32 MiB normal in-flight materialized-byte budget.
- `AttachmentExecutionState` owns request-local completed/pending/inline maps and unique counters; `resolveAttachmentCandidate(...)` owns materialization and authenticated/anonymous policy; `aggregateAttachmentResults(...)` owns ordered partitions, per-reference bytes, prompt notes, usage, logs, and stage telemetry.

### 3. Contracts

- Hash `materialized.bytes` directly; never prepend metadata into a payload-sized temporary buffer.
- Include normalized MIME and filename alongside the payload digest.
- Preserve pending-promise deduplication and result ordering.
- Install pending work before awaiting and remove only that promise in `finally`; a failed pending upload must not poison later candidates.
- Weight admission is FIFO. An attachment above the normal budget may run only when no other weighted item is active, so valid large files still make progress.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Same bytes, MIME, and filename -> one upload and repeated ordered references.
- Same bytes with different MIME or filename -> distinct dedupe keys.
- One valid item exceeds 32 MiB -> run alone; queued items resume after release.
- Mapper throws -> release weight in `finally`.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: digest the existing `Uint8Array`, then format a small metadata-plus-hex key.
- Good: keep the executor as orchestration while state, candidate policy, and aggregation expose narrow domain APIs.
- Base: output arrays retain input order when completion order differs.
- Bad: allocate `new Uint8Array(prefix.length + payload.length)` solely for hashing.
- Bad: permanently queue a valid attachment because it exceeds the normal aggregate budget.

### 6. Tests Required

- Test dedupe equivalence and MIME/filename distinctions.
- Test FIFO weighted concurrency, ordered results, error release, and oversized-item progress.
- Preserve request-local pending-upload dedupe integration tests.
- Benchmark a large attachment key against the former copy-based path.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
const copy = new Uint8Array(prefix.byteLength + materialized.bytes.byteLength);
copy.set(prefix);
copy.set(materialized.bytes, prefix.byteLength);
```

#### Correct

```typescript
const digest = await crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256", materialized.bytes);
return `${materialized.mime}\0${materialized.filename}\0${bytesToHex(new Uint8Array(digest))}`;
```

## Scenario: Tool-Sieve Held Candidate Performance

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing `src/toolcall/sieve.ts`, DSML/XML parsing, streamed candidate holding, or markdown-protected tool-looking text.

### 2. Signatures

- `createToolSieveState()` creates the only valid in-process sieve state.
- `processToolSieveChunk(state, chunk)` returns plain text chunks that are safe to emit.
- `flushToolSieve(state)` returns `{ text, toolCalls }`, where `toolCalls` is parsed `{ name, input }[] | null`.
- `parseCanonicalDSMLToolCallsFast(text)` handles only straightforward canonical XML before the tolerant parser.

### 3. Contracts

- `src/toolcall/sieve.ts` owns stream buffer state; completion consumes it, and HTTP adapters must not import it directly.
- The sieve never formats OpenAI or Google wire objects. Schema normalization and wire formatting happen once at each protocol edge.
- State fields are required and created by `createToolSieveState()`; do not add compatibility repair for hand-built legacy states.
- A held candidate is confirmed by a complete opening tag, not by rescanning the whole growing buffer as a partial prefix.
- `heldTail` is bounded to 128 characters, and held chunks avoid quadratic concatenation.
- Canonical fast parsing rejects confusable, alias, fenced, missing-wrapper, markdown-protected, and backtick-bearing inputs so the tolerant parser handles them.
- Malformed real-looking tool syntax remains buffered until flush; Markdown examples are released as plain text.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- 240 KB canonical candidate split into 1 KB chunks -> benchmark remains under the configured gate.
- Valid split DSML -> parsed calls with structured `name` and `input`.
- Malformed or oversized candidate -> released as text without leaking partial markup mid-stream.
- Fenced Markdown example -> plain text, no tool call.
- Confusable or alias DSML -> tolerant parser, not fast path.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: completion receives parsed calls and HTTP formats them once.
- Base: final argument parsing delegates to existing XML/DSML helpers.
- Bad: make the sieve depend on `openai-format.ts` or `ToolBundle`.
- Bad: pass a hand-built partial state and add migration repair to support it.

### 6. Tests Required

- Unit-test canonical fast-path acceptance/rejection, split candidates, malformed/oversized candidates, Markdown protection, and parsed flush results.
- Route-test OpenAI Chat, Responses, and Google wire output plus tool-policy violations.
- Run `pnpm check:bench` and keep `stream_sieve_held_tool` below its configured threshold.
- Run `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:arch`, `pnpm unit`, `pnpm coverage:ci`, and `pnpm smoke`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
const toolCalls = formatOpenAIToolCalls(parsed.calls, tools);
return { text: parsed.cleanText, toolCalls };
```

#### Correct

```typescript
return { text: parsed.cleanText, toolCalls: parsed.calls };
```

## Scenario: Shared Completion Stream Lifecycle

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing completion events or OpenAI Chat, OpenAI
Responses, or Google streaming adapters.

### 2. Signatures

- `createCompletionStreamLifecycle()` creates protocol-neutral stream state.
- `recordCompletionStreamEvent(lifecycle, event)` records output, terminal issue,
  empty output, tool calls, policy violation, and completion counts.
- `classifyCompletionStreamOutcome(facts)` returns `failed_before_output`,
  `interrupted_after_output`, `policy_violation`, `empty`, or `ok`.

### 3. Contracts

- Completion owns lifecycle state and terminal outcome precedence; HTTP adapters
  map outcomes to protocol JSON/SSE framing.
- Record every completion event exactly once before protocol-specific handling.
- A terminal issue wins over policy validation; policy validation runs only after
  normal completion. Abort propagation, coalescer flushes, and terminal frame
  ordering remain protocol-specific and behavior-compatible.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- text then warning -> `emittedText=true` and terminal issue retained.
- empty event -> `empty=true`; adapter emits its existing fallback.
- done event -> completion counts replace initial empty counts.
- issue plus policy violation -> issue outcome; policy is not validated after an
  upstream issue.
- abort -> event producer throws; no lifecycle error conversion occurs.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: update the central lifecycle reducer when adding a new stateful event.
- Base: adapters branch only for protocol payload emission.
- Bad: recreate local `issue`, `empty`, and completion-count reducers per adapter.

### 6. Tests Required

- Unit-test lifecycle reduction for text, empty, issue, tool, and done events.
- Unit-test outcome precedence for issue, policy violation, visible output, and
  normal empty completion.
- Run OpenAI and Google streaming route tests plus smoke and coverage gates.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
if (event.type === "warning") issue = event;
else if (event.type === "done") completionCounts = event.completionCounts;
```

#### Correct

```typescript
for await (const event of completionEvents) {
  recordCompletionStreamEvent(lifecycle, event);
  if (event.type === "text_delta") await writeProtocolDelta(event.text);
}
const outcome = classifyCompletionStreamOutcome(lifecycle);
```
