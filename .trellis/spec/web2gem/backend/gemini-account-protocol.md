# Gemini Account Protocol

## Scenario: Stable Identity And Capability Storage

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing account import, D1 account schema, Cookie refresh writeback, status persistence, or model-capability storage.

### 2. Signatures

- `identityHashFromCookie(cookie)` is SHA-256 of normalized bare `__Secure-1PSID`.
- `cookie_hash` is SHA-256 of the complete normalized stored Cookie header.
- `gemini_accounts.identity_hash` is `NOT NULL UNIQUE`.
- `gemini_account_models` is keyed by `(account_id, model_id)` and stores
  bounded display metadata, availability, capacity `1..4`, capacity field
  `12|13`, model number `1..64`, discovery order `0..127`, and `checked_at_ms`.
- `gemini_model_route_priority` stores one ordered exact tuple per known family
  and mutation batches bump `gemini_pool_meta.pool_version`.
- `GeminiAccountSecretRow` is exactly `id`, `cookie_header`, `cookie_hash`,
  `identity_hash`, and `last_refresh_success_at_ms`; `getAccountForRefresh`
  selects only those columns.
- Bulk import entries carry the authoritative identity at
  `entry.input.identityHash`. The compact result is
  `{ createdAccountIds, changedCredentialCount }`.

### 3. Contracts

- This is a pre-release schema: edit `migrations/0001_gemini_accounts.sql` directly and reset older development databases. Do not add backfill, compatibility gates, or nullable legacy identity states.
- Re-importing the same PSID with a changed PSIDTS updates the canonical
  account's credential version without replacing its ID.
- Concurrent same-identity imports converge through the unique identity constraint and canonical re-read/upsert behavior.
- Bulk import re-reads only `identity_hash,id` to recover canonical IDs. Do not
  build Admin summaries or cookie-hash maps when no caller consumes them.
- Raw Cookies, identity hashes, Cookie hashes, RPC arrays, localized model descriptions, and raw status payloads never enter admin DTOs or logs.
- Replace capability rows only after a complete successful probe. Failed/empty/unknown probes preserve the previous snapshot as stale.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Missing PSID -> reject before persistence.
- Same identity, same credential version -> unchanged import.
- Same identity, new credential version -> update canonical row and invalidate credential-scoped caches through `cookie_hash`.
- Duplicate full Cookie under another identity -> unique-constraint failure; never merge identities silently.
- Probe decode failure -> no status-health success and no capability replacement.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: one PSID row survives repeated PSIDTS rotation imports.
- Base: a new PSID creates one new account and capability rows only after probing.
- Bad: use the full Cookie hash as stable identity or expose identity hashes for conflict diagnostics.

### 6. Tests Required

- Fresh-schema initialization and required unique identity.
- Same-identity re-import and concurrent uniqueness convergence.
- Cookie-version change without account-ID change.
- Exact refresh-secret SQL projection and bulk created/changed/unchanged parity
  for D1 and one-by-one fallback stores.
- Atomic bounded capability replacement, failed-probe preservation, exact route
  priority replacement/reset, Worker/Docker query parity, and bind redaction.
- Run account, Docker, static, type, architecture, Worker-type, and full unit gates.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
const identityHash = await sha256Hex(normalizedCookieHeader);
```

#### Correct

```typescript
const identityHash = await identityHashFromCookie(normalizedCookieHeader);
const cookieHash = await sha256Hex(normalizedCookieHeader);
```

## Scenario: Capability-aware Selection And Session Freshness

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing account lease selection, model-header resolution, cross-account attempt budgets, or post-success session maintenance.

### 2. Signatures

- `GEMINI_ACCOUNT_CAPABILITY_MODE`: `off|prefer|strict`, default `prefer`.
- `GEMINI_ACCOUNT_CAPABILITY_TTL_SEC`: `60..604800`, default `3600`.
- `GEMINI_ACCOUNT_MAX_ATTEMPTS`: any positive safe integer, default `10`.
- `GEMINI_ACCOUNT_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SEC`: `0` or `60..604800`, default `600`.
- `capabilityFreshAfterMs(ttlSeconds, nowMs)` is the sole freshness cutoff
  calculation. Callers pass the current/injected clock explicitly; the helper
  preserves default `3600` seconds and minimum `60` seconds.
- Lease route requirements carry ordered exact
  `(providerModelId, capacity, capacityField, modelNumber)` candidates plus an
  optional known-family Basic fallback. Acquisition separately carries the
  capability mode and freshness cutoff; a successful lease returns the route
  validated or safely assigned for that exact account as `selectedRoute`.
- `GeminiAccountAttemptOrchestrator` owns distinct-account attempts, lease
  recovery, outcome persistence, and success maintenance for one provider.
- `UploadReplayState` owns generated upload recipes, immutable alias remapping,
  replay against a recovered account, and opaque-reference detection.

### 3. Contracts

- Resolve known public names to family plus extended intent; resolve unknown
  public IDs through the live/persisted model catalog before account acquisition.
- Reconcile saved family priority by retaining missing saved tuples in storage,
  skipping them at runtime, and appending newly discovered tuples in discovery
  order. Standard and `-extended` names share candidates.
- Evaluate exact candidates in priority order before least-local-in-flight and
  round-robin account selection within a candidate.
- Route binding happens after final account selection. Never attach the first
  global candidate to an independently selected account.
- `prefer`: choose fresh known-capable accounts first; use unknown/stale accounts
  only when no known-capable account exists, and bind the known family's Basic
  fallback. Fresh known-incapable accounts are skipped.
- A capability snapshot is fresh when at least one valid capability row for the
  account meets the freshness cutoff. Do not use the account status timestamp
  as a substitute for capability-snapshot freshness.
- Application catalog, completion acquisition/model resolution, and Admin
  routing use the same explicit-time cutoff helper; do not recreate config-only
  wrappers in those modules.
- `strict`: return no account unless a fresh known-capable account exists.
  `off`: preserve ordinary pool selection, then bind the first fresh candidate
  actually supported by that selected account or the known-family Basic
  fallback.
- Unknown dynamic IDs have no fallback route and require a fresh exact-capable
  account in `off`, `prefer`, and `strict` modes.
- Preserve least-local-in-flight and round-robin ordering within a capability tier.
- Load selected-account capabilities through the selected account IDs. Keep the
  bounded global capability query separate for persisted catalog fallback so
  unrelated accounts cannot displace runtime selection data.
- Cross-account budget counts distinct account IDs, not same-account transport retries. Never retry one ID solely to spend the budget; eligible pool size is the natural ceiling.
- Semantic recovery scope, abort, stream output, and attachment replay safety remain stronger gates than numeric budget.
- Generated attachment/text references may switch accounts only after every
  recorded recipe replays with the same reference count. Opaque external refs
  pin the request to the current account.
- Replay `401`, `429`, and transient transport/upstream failures return to the
  unified account outcome classification and may continue on another untried
  account. Replay count/invalid-reference integrity failures use
  `gemini_upload_replay_failed` and remain terminal.
- Release the lease only after capturing the selected lease for persistence and
  maintenance. Abort never records failure; post-delta stream errors never
  fail over; `waitUntil` registration failure never changes a completed result.
- Successful Worker requests may schedule session-only maintenance through the bound `execution_ctx.waitUntil(promise)`. It must not block/change the response or run the full status/capability probe.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Prefer + known capable -> select known capable.
- Prefer + only unknown/stale known-family accounts -> select one with the Basic
  fallback route.
- Prefer + fresh snapshot without the requested route -> skip that account as
  known-incapable.
- Strict + no fresh known capable -> `no_available_gemini_account`.
- Dynamic model + no fresh exact-capable account in any mode ->
  `no_available_gemini_account`.
- Runtime returns a lease without the prepared exact dynamic route ->
  `gemini_route_not_selected` (502); release that lease and stop traversal.
- Off-mode failover to a different account -> recompute route binding for the
  second account; never reuse the first account's route.
- Static/global `1052`, StreamGenerate `1060`, abort, post-delta failure, or opaque refs -> no blind pool traversal.
- Replay returns a different reference count or an invalid ref ->
  `gemini_upload_replay_failed` (502), then stop traversal.
- Refresh interval `0` or fresh session -> no background refresh.
- `waitUntil` registration/background failure -> safe log only; completed response remains successful.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: Pro request selects the first configured exact tuple that has a fresh
  eligible account, and payload/header use the lease's same tuple.
- Base: an unprobed pool remains usable in `prefer` mode.
- Base: `off` selects an account in ordinary pool order and uses its own exact
  route or the family Basic fallback.
- Bad: use `status_checked_at_ms` to classify capability freshness or bind
  `candidates[0]` to an arbitrary/fallback account.
- Bad: query capability rows once per candidate on every request or destructure `waitUntil` from the execution context.

### 6. Tests Required

- Off/prefer/strict tier selection, fresh/stale/unknown/incapable snapshots,
  account-bound failover routes, dynamic exact-only behavior, selected-versus-
  global capability loading, and bounded D1 reads.
- Default ten attempts, configured large value, natural pool exhaustion, and transport-retry separation.
- Abort/post-delta/attachment/static-error guards.
- Missing selected-route and invalid/count-mismatched upload replay errors must
  assert terminal recovery with no extra account acquisition.
- Replay `401`, `429`, and transient failures must assert classified recovery,
  exact exclusions, replay order, and lease outcome ordering across accounts.
- `waitUntil` registration, interval disable/freshness, lock/dedupe reuse, and background failure isolation.
- Run focused HTTP/runtime tests, full unit, benchmark, size, Worker types, static, type, and architecture gates.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
const { waitUntil } = cfg.execution_ctx;
waitUntil(refreshPromise);
```

#### Correct

```typescript
cfg.execution_ctx.waitUntil(refreshPromise);
```

## Scenario: Dynamic Model Headers And Passive Session Maintenance

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing GetUserStatus capacity decoding, selected
account model headers, Gemini response Cookie handling, or account import
initialization.

### 2. Signatures

- Probe models carry `{ modelId, displayName, description, available, capacity,
  capacityField, modelNumber, discoveryOrder }`.
- Known capacity precedence returns `(1,13)` for tier `21`, `(2,13)` for tier
  `22`, `(4,12)` for capability `115`, `(3,12)` for tier `16` or capability
  `106`, `(2,12)` for tier `8` or capability `19`, and `(1,12)` otherwise.
- A lease exposes `selectedRoute`, `modelCapability`, and
  `flushObservedCookies()`.
- `buildGeminiModelHeaders(route, extended, sessionId)` writes provider ID,
  capacity, capacity field, model number, extended flag `1|2`, and one
  provider-session UUID. Generation payload indexes are `17=[[0]]`,
  `79=modelNumber`, and `80=extended ? 2 : 1`.
- `RuntimeConfig.gemini_account.observeSetCookie(values)` is an internal
  in-memory response observer.
- `verifyGeminiAccount({ config, level })` returns only the verification status
  and optional bounded probe; the page-token `at` value is an internal verifier
  input for the status RPC and is never a public result field or persisted
  account data.
- Account import schedules one full `refreshAccountForAdmin` for each newly
  created canonical account ID with concurrency `4`.

### 3. Contracts

- Narrow and bound unknown flag arrays in `probe.ts`; never persist raw flags.
- Public resolution never carries `modelHeaders`. Authenticated execution builds
  model headers only after exact-route lease selection and uses that same route's
  model number in the payload.
- Anonymous generation is limited to Flash-family plain text/stream requests.
  It uses model number `1`, extended flag `1|2`, no model-specific header, no
  credentials, and no D1 read before a non-abort pre-output fallback is needed.
- Invoke the Cookie observer only from successful Gemini `/app` and
  `StreamGenerate` responses. The client stages header values and performs no
  D1 write.
- Flush staged Cookies only after logical request success. Re-read the current
  account under the existing distributed refresh lock, merge response Cookies,
  remove `SNlM0e`, `at`, and `session_token`, verify stable PSID identity, skip
  unchanged hashes, and use the duplicate-safe Cookie writer.
- Failed, aborted, or retired leases discard staged response Cookies.
- Worker success maintenance uses the bound `execution_ctx.waitUntil`; Docker
  awaits it. Cookie persistence failure never changes model output.
- Import probing applies only to newly created identities. Worker imports
  register the bounded batch with `waitUntil`; Docker imports await the batch.
  Probe failures never change the compact import mutation counts.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Unknown/malformed flags -> bounded default capacity `(1,12)`.
- Malformed D1 route tuples -> skip at the row-mapping boundary; do not use type
  assertions to admit them into catalog, priority, or lease state.
- Anonymous Pro, Flash Lite, attachment, rich/image, or large-context request ->
  bypass anonymous and require authenticated routing.
- Non-success response, anonymous config, or no `Set-Cookie` -> no observation.
- Missing/changed PSID, unchanged normalized hash, duplicate Cookie, or lock
  conflict -> no passive lease mutation.
- Successful Cookie write -> update lease Cookie, hash, config, local snapshot,
  and session freshness together.
- Re-imported existing identity -> no automatic probe; new identity -> exactly
  one bounded probe.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: a fresh Plus capability rewrites field 12 to capacity 4 for the leased
  account, then a successful response asynchronously persists a new PSIDTS.
- Base: a known family in `prefer` mode may use its internal Basic tuple for an
  unprobed/stale account only when no discovered exact tuple is selectable.
- Bad: expose a static/public `modelHeaders` field, use the first integer in
  upstream flags, write Cookie headers directly inside the client, persist page
  tokens, or probe unchanged imports.

### 6. Tests Required

- Cover every documented capacity branch, field-12/field-13 header shape,
  standard/extended payload flags, anonymous header absence, and stale fallback.
- Cover capability metadata through D1 snapshot, pool selection, lease, and
  text/rich/stream delegate headers.
- Cover `/app` and StreamGenerate observation, transient-field filtering,
  identity mismatch, unchanged hash, duplicate race, lock conflict, Worker
  `waitUntil`, Docker awaiting, and background failure isolation.
- Cover new-only import probing, concurrency `4`, compact mutation preservation,
  static/type/architecture, full unit, coverage, benchmark, size, Worker types,
  and smoke gates.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
const capacity = firstBoundedInt(tierFlags);
await store.writeRefreshedCookie(accountId, mergeCookies(response.headers));
```

#### Correct

```typescript
const resolved = await runtime.resolveModel(name, defaultName, freshAfterMs);
const routes = await runtime.routeCandidatesForModel(resolved, freshAfterMs);
const routeRequirement = {
  candidates: routes,
  fallbackRoute: resolved.family ? basicRouteForFamily(resolved.family) : null,
};
const lease = await runtime.acquireLease(cfg, {
  routeRequirement,
  capabilityMode: mode,
  capabilityFreshAfterMs: freshAfterMs,
});
const headers = buildGeminiModelHeaders(lease.selectedRoute, resolved.extended, sessionId);
```

## Scenario: Public Model Catalog And Admin Route Policy

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing `/v1/models`, `/v1beta/models`, dynamic model
resolution, model-routing Admin API/WebUI, or route-priority persistence.

### 2. Signatures

- Known public names are exactly `gemini-3.1-pro`, `gemini-3.5-flash`,
  `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, and their `-extended` variants.
- Unknown discovered IDs that do not collide with a known public name project
  to `<id>` and, when that synthesized name does not collide with another exact
  provider ID, `<id>-extended`.
- Admin endpoints are `GET /admin/model-routing`, `PUT
  /admin/model-routing/{family}`, and `DELETE /admin/model-routing/{family}`.
- PUT body is `{ routes: GeminiRouteTuple[] }`, maximum 128 unique tuples.
- `validateGeminiModelRoutePolicy(family, routes)` is the pure owner of family,
  exact four-field tuple shape/ranges, the 128-entry limit, and duplicates.
- `parseGoogleGenerationPath(path)` removes the final
  `:generateContent|:streamGenerateContent` action before decoding and returns
  `{ modelName, stream }`; completion preparation accepts that normalized model
  name rather than an HTTP path.

### 3. Contracts

- Build one ordered catalog: anonymous Flash pair first, then fresh available
  account records in pool/discovery order with first-public-ID wins. If no fresh
  catalog is usable, use the last complete persisted model snapshot.
- Reserve every available unknown provider ID as an exact standard public name
  before synthesizing `-extended` aliases. An exact provider ID always wins a
  collision; suppress the conflicting synthesized alias so resolution can never
  route an exact request to a different provider model.
- `MODELS` owns all six known public names. Dynamic provider IDs that equal any
  known standard or extended public name are not projected into the catalog;
  only a discovered route belonging to the corresponding known family may add
  that public entry.
- OpenAI and Google lists/details project the same IDs/order; health stays fixed
  to six known names and never reads D1 or exposes dynamic IDs.
- Ordinary public auth happens before catalog D1 access. Catalog D1 failure
  degrades to the anonymous Flash pair.
- Basic/Plus/Advanced labels and exact tuples are ADMIN_KEY-only internal data.
  Custom model configuration is unsupported.
- Model-routing handlers authenticate first, then match method/path/family,
  validate query and body only for a recognized operation, and construct the
  D1-backed service only after that validation. Unknown paths and unsupported
  methods retain the route/method error contract even when query parameters are
  present. Store methods reuse the pure policy validator as defense-in-depth
  without producing HTTP errors.
- Admin overview retains saved missing routes, appends new discovery routes, and
  exposes only bounded tuple facts, known label, availability, configured flag,
  and account count.
- `src/http/google/model-path.ts` is the sole owner of Google generation path
  grammar. Provider IDs may contain `:`, so parsing must remove the exact final
  action suffix instead of stopping at the first colon.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Removed alias or `@think=N` -> protocol-specific model-not-found.
- Unknown dynamic ID absent from current/fallback catalog -> model-not-found.
- Discovered `foo` plus exact provider ID `foo-extended` ->
  `foo-extended` resolves the exact provider model with standard thinking;
  `foo-extended-extended` resolves its extended variant, and no catalog entry
  maps `foo-extended` to provider `foo`.
- Dynamic provider ID `gemini-3.1-pro` -> suppress the dynamic projection. If a
  real Pro-family route is also discovered, the public entry belongs to that
  known route and resolves through Pro capability selection.
- Invalid family, extra body key, malformed/duplicate/oversized tuple array ->
  sanitized 4xx; account service/D1 is not constructed, and policy plus
  `pool_version` remain unchanged.
- Submitted tuple absent from persisted discovery and saved policy ->
  `unknown_model_route`; policy unchanged.
- Missing/invalid ADMIN_KEY -> 401 before routing-policy D1 access.
- Raw or percent-encoded provider ID `future:model` -> normalize to the exact
  model name for both Google generation actions; embedded or decoded `/`, empty
  names, malformed escapes, and unknown actions -> not a generation route.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: reorder Pro routes in WebUI; the next Worker and Docker request use the
  new order without deployment, while Flash and Flash Lite stay unchanged.
- Base: no D1 returns exactly the Flash standard/extended pair in both APIs.
- Base: a synthesized extended alias is omitted when it would shadow another
  exact dynamic provider ID.
- Base: a dynamic provider ID cannot claim a known standard or extended public
  name.
- Base: `/v1beta/models/future:model:generateContent` resolves provider ID
  `future:model`, not `future`.
- Bad: serialize module-load model constants, expose provider tuples publicly,
  delete missing saved routes, accept arbitrary custom model IDs, or let a
  synthesized suffix alias shadow an exact provider ID.

### 6. Tests Required

- Assert no-D1 Flash pair, live/persisted dynamic IDs, OpenAI/Google ID-order
  parity, known/unknown details, health D1 absence, and auth-before-D1 ordering.
- Assert simultaneous `<id>` and `<id>-extended` provider records preserve exact
  standard resolution before synthesized suffix parsing.
- Assert dynamic provider IDs colliding with known public names are suppressed
  and cannot displace the corresponding static family route.
- Assert raw and percent-encoded colon-bearing IDs survive Google route parsing
  and reach `CompletionProvider.resolveModel` unchanged.
- Assert three-family independence, capacity-3/field-13 round trip, missing/new
  reconciliation, invalid mutation atomicity, save/reset cache invalidation, and
  strict browser DTO validation.
- Assert invalid/unknown model-routing requests do not read the D1 binding after
  successful Admin authentication.
- Run static, type, architecture, account/runtime, HTTP, Admin UI, Docker, smoke,
  Worker-type, benchmark, size, full unit, and coverage gates.
